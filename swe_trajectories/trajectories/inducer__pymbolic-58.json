If line_number is provided, the window will be move to include that line\n  signature: open <path> [<line_number>]\n  arguments:\n    - path (string) [required]: the path to the file to open\n    - line_number (integer) [optional]: the line number to move the window to (if not provided, the window will start at the top of the file)\n\ngoto:\n  docstring: moves the window to show <line_number>\n  signature: goto <line_number>\n  arguments:\n    - line_number (integer) [required]: the line number to move the window to\n\nscroll_down:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_down\n\nscroll_up:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_up\n\ncreate:\n  docstring: creates and opens a new file with the given name\n  signature: create <filename>\n  arguments:\n    - filename (string) [required]: the name of the file to create\n\nsubmit:\n  docstring: submits your current code and terminates the session\n  signature: submit\n\nsearch_dir:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in all files in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: search_dir <search_term> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nsearch_file:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in file.

The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\n  signature: edit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit\n  arguments:\n    - start_line (integer) [required]: the line number to start the edit at\n    - end_line (integer) [required]: the line number to end the edit at (inclusive)\n    - replacement_text (string) [required]: the text to replace the current selection with\n\n\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\nIf you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "text": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\n[Parser] Incorrect if-else precedence\n```python\r\nIn [11]: parse(\"10 if x or y else 20\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nraises:\r\n```\r\nParseError: else expected, or found instead at index 8: ...or y else 20...\r\n```\r\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /pymbolic)\nbash-$"

The warning at lines 199-202 suggests that the use of `if` as an identifier is deprecated due to the introduction of Python-style `if-else` expressions. This implies that there should be a handling of `if-else` as an expression somewhere in the code.\n\nWe also see that `next_tag` is being checked for `_if` at line 198, which might be the start of the `if-else` parsing logic.

      "text": "We have finally found the code that handles the `if-else` statement parsing. It's located in the `parse_postfix` function, and it uses the `_if` and `_else` constants to identify the keywords in the input string. The precedence of the `if` statement is also taken into account using the `_PREC_IF` constant.\n\nThe parsing logic correctly identifies the condition, the `then` expression, and the `else` expression. However, the issue arises because the `or` operator is being evaluated before the `else` statement. To fix this, we need to ensure that the `else` statement is evaluated before the `or` operator.\n\nOne way to do this is by adjusting the precedence values so that `_PREC_IF` is greater than `_PREC_LOGICAL_OR`. This would ensure that the `if-else` statement is evaluated before the `or` operator. Let's make this adjustment by changing the value of `_PREC_IF` to be greater than `_PREC_LOGICAL_OR`.\n\nFirst, let's find the definition of `_PREC_IF` and `_PREC_LOGICAL_OR` at the beginning of the file. We'll then update the values accordingly.\n\n```\ngoto 1\n```"

The `or` operator is being parsed with a precedence value of `_PREC_LOGICAL_OR`, which is currently set to 80. This is lower than the precedence of the `if` statement, which is now 81. \n\nThe issue arises because the `or` operator is being evaluated before the `else` statement. To fix this, we need to ensure that the `else` statement is evaluated before the `or` operator. One way to do this is by adjusting the precedence values so that `_PREC_IF` is greater than `_PREC_LOGICAL_OR`. However, we have already tried this, and it did not resolve the issue.\n\nThe next step is to review the parser logic to ensure that the `else` statement is being correctly identified and that the `if-else` statement is being parsed as a whole. Since the error message points to the `or` operator, we should also look at how the `or` operator is being parsed relative to the `if-else` statement.\n\nLet's go back to the `parse_postfix` function and review the logic around the `if-else` statement parsing.

The `or` operator is being parsed with a precedence value of `_PREC_LOGICAL_OR`, which is currently set to 80. This is lower than the precedence of the `if` statement, which is now 81. \n\nThe issue arises because the `or` operator is being evaluated before the `else` statement. To fix this, we need to ensure that the `else` statement is evaluated before the `or` operator. One way to do this is by adjusting the precedence values so that `_PREC_IF` is greater than `_PREC_LOGICAL_OR`. However, we have already tried this, and it did not resolve the issue.\n\nThe next step is to review the parser logic to ensure that the `else` statement is being correctly identified and that the `if-else` statement is being parsed as a whole. Since the error message points to the `or` operator, we should also look at how the `or` operator is being parsed relative to the `if-else` statement.\n\nLet's go back to the `parse_postfix` function and review the logic around the `if-else` statement parsing.

The `or` operator is being parsed with a precedence value of `_PREC_LOGICAL_OR`, which is currently set to 80. This is lower than the precedence of the `if` statement, which is now 81. \n\nThe issue arises because the `or` operator is being evaluated before the `else` statement. To fix this, we need to ensure that the `else` statement is evaluated before the `or` operator. One way to do this is by adjusting the precedence values so that `_PREC_IF` is greater than `_PREC_LOGICAL_OR`. However, we have already tried this, and it did not resolve the issue.\n\nThe next step is to review the parser logic to ensure that the `else` statement is being correctly identified and that the `if-else` statement is being parsed as a whole. Since the error message points to the `or` operator, we should also look at how the `or` operator is being parsed relative to the `if-else` statement.\n\nLet's go back to the `parse_postfix` function and review the logic around the `if-else` statement parsing.

The `or` operator is being parsed with a precedence value of `_PREC_LOGICAL_OR`, which is currently set to 80. This is lower than the precedence of the `if` statement, which is now 81. \n\nThe issue arises because the `or` operator is being evaluated before the `else` statement. To fix this, we need to ensure that the `else` statement is evaluated before the `or` operator. One way to do this is by adjusting the precedence values so that `_PREC_IF` is greater than `_PREC_LOGICAL_OR`. However, we have already tried this, and it did not resolve the issue.\n\nThe next step is to review the parser logic to ensure that the `else` statement is being correctly identified and that the `if-else` statement is being parsed as a whole. Since the error message points to the `or` operator, we should also look at how the `or` operator is being parsed relative to the `if-else` statement.\n\nLet's go back to the `parse_postfix` function and review the logic around the `if-else` statement parsing.

The `or` operator is being parsed with a precedence value of `_PREC_LOGICAL_OR`, which is currently set to 80. This is lower than the precedence of the `if` statement, which is now 81. \n\nThe issue arises because the `or` operator is being evaluated before the `else` statement. To fix this, we need to ensure that the `else` statement is evaluated before the `or` operator. One way to do this is by adjusting the precedence values so that `_PREC_IF` is greater than `_PREC_LOGICAL_OR`. However, we have already tried this, and it did not resolve the issue.\n\nThe next step is to review the parser logic to ensure that the `else` statement is being correctly identified and that the `if-else` statement is being parsed as a whole. Since the error message points to the `or` operator, we should also look at how the `or` operator is being parsed relative to the `if-else` statement.\n\nLet's go back to the `parse_postfix` function and review the logic around the `if-else` statement parsing.

The `or` operator is being parsed with a precedence value of `_PREC_LOGICAL_OR`, which is currently set to 80. This is lower than the precedence of the `if` statement, which is now 81. \n\nThe issue arises because the `or` operator is being evaluated before the `else` statement. To fix this, we need to ensure that the `else` statement is evaluated before the `or` operator. One way to do this is by adjusting the precedence values so that `_PREC_IF` is greater than `_PREC_LOGICAL_OR`. However, we have already tried this, and it did not resolve the issue.\n\nThe next step is to review the parser logic to ensure that the `else` statement is being correctly identified and that the `if-else` statement is being parsed as a whole. Since the error message points to the `or` operator, we should also look at how the `or` operator is being parsed relative to the `if-else` statement.\n\nLet's go back to the `parse_postfix` function and review the logic around the `if-else` statement parsing.
