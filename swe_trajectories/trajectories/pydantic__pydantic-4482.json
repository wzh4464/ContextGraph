Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nFirst instantiation of generic Union model defines type coercion of models instantiated later\n### Initial Checks\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched GitHub for a duplicate issue and I'm sure this is something new\r\n- [X] I have searched Google & StackOverflow for a solution and couldn't find anything\r\n- [X] I have read and followed [the docs](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io) and still think this is a bug\r\n- [X] I am confident that the issue is with pydantic  (not my code, or another library in the ecosystem like [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) or [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable))\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen pydantic generic models are instantiated with Unions, the order of a particular set of types are fixed by the first instantiation, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Generic, TypeVar, Union\r\n\r\nfrom pydantic.generics import GenericModel\r\n\r\nNumberT = TypeVar('NumberT')\r\n\r\n\r\nclass NumberModel(GenericModel, Generic[NumberT]):\r\n    data: NumberT\r\n\r\n\r\nFloatOrIntModel = NumberModel[Union[float, int]]\r\nprint(FloatOrIntModel(data='1').data)\r\n\r\nIntOrFloatModel = NumberModel[Union[int, float]]\r\nprint(IntOrFloatModel(data='1').data)\r\n```\r\nprints\r\n```\r\n1.0\r\n1.0\r\n```\r\nWhile changing the order of the instantiations changes type coercion of both models:\r\n```\r\n1\r\n1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn pydantic, type coercion of Union models depends on the order of the types. However, as explained in the documentation on [Unions](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/types/#unions):\r\n\r\n> typing.Union also ignores order when [defined](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Union), so Union[int, float] == Union[float, int] which can lead to unexpected behaviour when combined with matching based on the Union type order inside other type definitions\r\n\r\nI think this should be considered a bug in pydantic, even though the user is warned against 'unexpected behaviour' combined with other code that depend on Union type equality. The unexpected behaviour in this case is caused by pydantic itself, there is no \"matching based on the Union type order inside other type definitions\" in the example code, nor are any third-party code imported. It is not difficult to envision situations where this dependency could cause very hard-to-find bugs.\r\n\r\nIt seems the cause of the error is the `_generic_types_cache` in `generics.py`, which caches the first Union model and uses this as the blueprint of later matching models (i.e. with the same set of types).\r\n\r\nSetting `smart_union` to `True` has no impact.\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/2835.\r\n\r\n### Example Code\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Python, Pydantic & OS Version\r\n\r\n```Text\r\npydantic version: 1.10.1\r\n            pydantic compiled: True\r\n                 install path: /Users/sveinugu/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/unifair-myuXak-6-py3.10/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pydantic\r\n               python version: 3.10.4 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Mar 24 2022, 17:42:03) [Clang 12.0.1 ]\r\n                     platform: macOS-11.2.3-arm64-arm-64bit\r\n     optional deps. installed: ['typing-extensions']\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Affected Components\r\n\r\n- [ ] [Compatibility between releases](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/changelog/)\r\n- [X] [Data validation/parsing](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/#basic-model-usage)\r\n- [ ] [Data serialization](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/exporting_models/) - `.dict()` and `.json()`\r\n- [ ] [JSON Schema](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/schema/)\r\n- [ ] [Dataclasses](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/dataclasses/)\r\n- [ ] [Model Config](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/model_config/)\r\n- [X] [Field Types](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/types/) - adding or changing a particular data type\r\n- [ ] [Function validation decorator](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/validation_decorator/)\r\n- [X] [Generic Models](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/#generic-models)\r\n- [ ] [Other Model behaviour](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/) - `construct()`, pickling, private attributes, ORM mode\r\n- [ ] [Settings Management](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/)\r\n- [ ] [Plugins](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) and integration with other tools - mypy, FastAPI, python-devtools, Hypothesis, VS Code, PyCharm, etc.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /pydantic)\nbash-$"
