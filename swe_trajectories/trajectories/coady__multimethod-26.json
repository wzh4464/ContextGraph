Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly.

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTypeError when one of the type hints is type or another metaclass\nUsing `type` (or any other subclass of `type`, e.g. a custom metaclass) as the type hint for one of the parameters of a function of a multimethod makes the dispatch process raise a `TypeError` when calling `type.mro()` (which expects the type object as an argument).\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@multimethod\r\ndef f(x: type):\r\n    print(\"success\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> f(int)\r\nsuccess\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> f(int)\r\nTypeError: unbound method type.mro() needs an argument\r\n```\r\n\r\nTraceback:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\Paolo\\Code\\JB-PycharmProjects\\LoveLetter\\venv\\lib\\site-packages\\IPython\\core\\interactiveshell.py\", line 3418, in run_code\r\n    exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)\r\n  File \"<ipython-input-34-0374cd2152b2>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n    f(int)\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\Paolo\\Code\\JB-PycharmProjects\\LoveLetter\\venv\\lib\\site-packages\\multimethod\\__init__.py\", line 184, in __call__\r\n    return self[tuple(map(self.get_type, args))](*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\Paolo\\Code\\JB-PycharmProjects\\LoveLetter\\venv\\lib\\site-packages\\multimethod\\__init__.py\", line 184, in __call__\r\n    return self[tuple(map(self.get_type, args))](*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\Paolo\\Code\\JB-PycharmProjects\\LoveLetter\\venv\\lib\\site-packages\\multimethod\\__init__.py\", line 174, in __missing__\r\n    groups = groupby(signature(types).__sub__, self.parents(types))\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\Paolo\\Code\\JB-PycharmProjects\\LoveLetter\\venv\\lib\\site-packages\\multimethod\\__init__.py\", line 17, in groupby\r\n    groups[func(value)].append(value)\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\Paolo\\Code\\JB-PycharmProjects\\LoveLetter\\venv\\lib\\site-packages\\multimethod\\__init__.py\", line 104, in __sub__\r\n    return tuple(mro.index(cls if cls in mro else object) for mro, cls in zip(mros, other))\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\Paolo\\Code\\JB-PycharmProjects\\LoveLetter\\venv\\lib\\site-packages\\multimethod\\__init__.py\", line 104, in <genexpr>\r\n    return tuple(mro.index(cls if cls in mro else object) for mro, cls in zip(mros, other))\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\Paolo\\Code\\JB-PycharmProjects\\LoveLetter\\venv\\lib\\site-packages\\multimethod\\__init__.py\", line 103, in <genexpr>\r\n    mros = (subclass.mro() for subclass in self)\r\nTypeError: unbound method type.mro() needs an argument\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Cause\r\n\r\nMethods of metaclasses like `type`, e.g. `.mro()` expect an explicit first argument which is the actual type object being used.\r\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /multimethod)\nbash-$"

The decorator creates a multimethod object as needed, and registers the function with its annotations.\n+\n+There are several multiple dispatch libraries on PyPI. This one aims for simplicity and speed. With caching of argument types, it should be the fastest pure Python implementation possible.\n+\n+## Usage\n+### multimethod\n+```python\n+from multimethod import multimethod\n+\n+@multimethod\n+def func(x: int, y: float):\n+    ...\n+```\n+\n+`func` is now a `multimethod` which will delegate to the above function, when called with arguments of the specified types.

This syntax is also compatible with [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org), which by default checks that [each name is defined once](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/error_code_list.html#check-that-each-name-is-defined-once-no-redef).\n+\n+```python\n+@func.register\n+def _(x: bool, y: bool):\n+    ...\n+\n+\n+@func.register(object, bool)\n+@func.register(bool, object)\n+def _(x, y):  # stackable without annotations\n+    ...\n+```\n+\n+Multimethods are implemented as mappings from signatures to functions, and can be introspected as such.\n+\n+```python\n+method[type, ...]           # get registered function\n+method[type, ...] = func    # register function by explicit types\n+```\n+\n+Multimethods support any types that satisfy the `issubclass` relation, including abstract base classes in `collections.abc` and `typing`. Subscripted generics are provisionally supported:\n+* `Union[...]`\n+* `Mapping[...]` - the first key-value pair is checked\n+* `Tuple[...]` - all args are checked\n+* `Iterable[...]` - the first arg is checked\n+\n+Naturally checking subscripts is slower, but the implementation is optimized, cached, and bypassed if no subscripts are in use in the multimethod.\n+\n+Dispatch resolution details:\n+* If an exact match isn't registered, the next closest method is called (and cached).\n+* If the `issubclass` relation is ambiguous,\n+[mro](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=mro#class.mro) position is used as a tie-breaker.\n+* If there are still ambiguous methods - or none - a custom `TypeError` is raised.\n+* Default and keyword arguments may be used, but won't affect the dispatching.\n+* A skipped annotation is equivalent to `: object`, which implicitly supports methods by leaving `self` blank.\n+* If no types are specified, it will inherently match all arguments.\n+\n+### overload\n+Overloads dispatch on annotated predicates. Each predicate is checked in the reverse order of registration.\n+\n+The implementation is separate from `multimethod` due to the different performance characteristics. Instead a simple `isa` predicate is provided for checking instance type.\n+\n+```python\n+from multimethod import isa, overload\n+\n+@overload\n+def func(obj: isa(str)):\n+    ...\n+\n+@overload\n+def func(obj: str.isalnum):\n+    ...\n+\n+@overload\n+def func(obj: str.isdigit):\n+    ...\n+```\n+\n+### multimeta\n+\n+Use `metaclass=multimeta` to create a class with a special namespace which converts callables to multimethods, and registers duplicate callables with the original.\n+\n+```python\n+from multimethod import multimeta\n+\n+class Foo(metaclass=multimeta):\n+    def bar(self, x: str):\n+        ...\n+        \n+    def bar(self, x: int):\n+        ...\n+```\n+\n+Equivalent to:\n+\n+```python\n+from multimethod import multimethod\n+\n+class Foo:\n+    @multimethod\n+    def bar(self, x: str):\n+        ...\n+        \n+    @bar.register\n+    def bar(self, x: int):\n+        ...\n+```\n+\n+## Installation\n+\n+```console\n+% pip install multimethod\n+```\n+\n+## Tests\n+100% branch coverage.\n+\n+```console\n+% pytest [--cov]\n+```\n+\n+## Changes\n+dev\n+\n+* Postponed evaluation of nested annotations\n+* Variable-length tuples of homogeneous type\n+* Ignore default and keyword arguments\n+* Resolved ambiguous `Union` types\n+* Fixed an issue with name collision when defining a multimethod\n+\n+1.4\n+\n+* Python >=3.6 required\n+* Expanded support for subscripted type hints\n+\n+1.3\n+\n+* Python 3 required\n+* Support for subscripted ABCs\n+\n+1.2\n+\n+* Support for typing generics\n+* Stricter dispatching consistent with singledispatch\n+\n+1.1\n+\n+* Fix for Python 2 typing backport\n+* Metaclass for automatic multimethods\n+\n+1.0\n+\n+* Missing annotations default to object\n+* Removed deprecated dispatch stacking\n+\n+0.7\n+\n+* Forward references allowed in type hints\n+* Register method\n+* Overloads with predicate dispatch\n+\n+0.6\n+\n+* Multimethods can be defined inside a class\n+\n+0.5\n+\n+* Optimized dispatching\n+* Support for `functools.singledispatch` syntax\n+\n+0.4\n+\n+* Dispatch on Python 3 annotations\ndiff --git a/multimethod.egg-info/SOURCES.txt b/multimethod.egg-info/SOURCES.txt\nnew file mode 100644\nindex 0000000..31c7b55\n--- /dev/null\n+++ b/multimethod.egg-info/SOURCES.txt\n@@ -0,0 +1,17 @@\n+LICENSE.txt\n+MANIFEST.in\n+README.md\n+pyproject.toml\n+setup.cfg\n+setup.py\n+multimethod/__init__.py\n+multimethod/py.typed\n+multimethod.egg-info/PKG-INFO\n+multimethod.egg-info/SOURCES.txt\n+multimethod.egg-info/dependency_links.txt\n+multimethod.egg-info/not-zip-safe\n+multimethod.egg-info/top_level.txt\n+tests/__init__.py\n+tests/test_dispatch.py\n+tests/test_docstring.py\n+tests/test_methods.py\n\\ No newline at end of file\ndiff --git a/multimethod.egg-info/dependency_links.txt b/multimethod.egg-info/dependency_links.txt\nnew file mode 100644\nindex 0000000..8b13789\n--- /dev/null\n+++ b/multimethod.egg-info/dependency_links.txt\n@@ -0,0 +1 @@\n+\ndiff --git a/multimethod.egg-info/not-zip-safe b/multimethod.egg-info/not-zip-safe\nnew file mode 100644\nindex 0000000..8b13789\n--- /dev/null\n+++ b/multimethod.egg-info/not-zip-safe\n@@ -0,0 +1 @@\n+\ndiff --git a/multimethod.egg-info/top_level.txt b/multimethod.egg-info/top_level.txt\nnew file mode 100644\nindex 0000000..e466209\n--- /dev/null\n+++ b/multimethod.egg-info/top_level.txt\n@@ -0,0 +1 @@\n+multimethod\n",
