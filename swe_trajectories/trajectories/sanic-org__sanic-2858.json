Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly.

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nWebsocket invalid upgrade exception handling b0rkage\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nA client apparently sent no Upgrade header to a websocket endpoint, leading to an error as it should. An ugly traceback is printed on terminal even though the error eventually gets handled correctly it would seem.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the websockets module attempts to attach its exception on `request._exception` field which Sanic's Request doesn't have a slot for. This could be hidden if Sanic later used `raise BadRequest(...) from None` rather than `raise SanicException(...)`, suppressing the chain and giving a non-500 error for what really is no server error. Not sure though if that would from this context ever reach the client anyway but at least it could avoid a traceback in server log.\r\n\r\nIf anyone wants to investigate and make a PR, feel free to (I am currently busy and cannot do that unfortunately).\r\n\r\n```python\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/user/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/websockets/server.py\", line 111, in accept\r\n    ) = self.process_request(request)\r\n  File \"/home/user/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/websockets/server.py\", line 218, in process_request\r\n    raise InvalidUpgrade(\"Upgrade\", \", \".join(upgrade) if upgrade else None)\r\nwebsockets.exceptions.InvalidUpgrade: missing Upgrade header\r\n\r\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/user/sanic/sanic/server/protocols/websocket_protocol.py\", line 120, in websocket_handshake\r\n    resp: \"http11.Response\" = ws_proto.accept(request)\r\n  File \"/home/user/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/websockets/server.py\", line 122, in accept\r\n    request._exception = exc\r\nAttributeError: 'Request' object has no attribute '_exception'\r\n\r\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"handle_request\", line 97, in handle_request\r\n  File \"/home/user/sanic/sanic/app.py\", line 1047, in _websocket_handler\r\n    ws = await protocol.websocket_handshake(request, subprotocols)\r\n  File \"/home/user/sanic/sanic/server/protocols/websocket_protocol.py\", line 126, in websocket_handshake\r\n    raise SanicException(msg, status_code=500)\r\nsanic.exceptions.SanicException: Failed to open a WebSocket connection.\r\nSee server log for more information.\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Code snippet\n\n_No response_\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n400 Bad Request error reaching the client and being more silent on server side. Including the message of **missing Upgrade header** would be helpful for debugging (e.g. in case Nginx proxy config forgot to forward that header).\n\n### How do you run Sanic?\n\nSanic CLI\n\n### Operating System\n\nLinux\n\n### Sanic Version\n\nAlmost 23.03.0 (a git version slightly before release)\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sanic)\nbash-$"
