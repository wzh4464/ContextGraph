Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "text": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nSettings: Custom parsing of environment variables (non-JSON)\n# Settings: Custom parsing of environment variables (non-JSON)\r\n\r\nOften we want complex environment variables that are not represented as JSON. One example is a list of items. It's not uncommon to comma-delimit lists like this in bash:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport os\r\nfrom typing import List\r\n\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseSettings\r\n\r\nos.environ['options'] = \"a,b,c\"\r\n\r\nclass Settings(BaseSettings):\r\n    options: List\r\n\r\ns = Settings()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis results in a `JSONDecodeError`. Writing a list of items as valid json is error prone and not human friendly to read in the context of environment variables.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nOne workaround is to store the variable as valid json, which is tricky to type correctly in lots of systems where you have to enter environment variables:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOPTIONS='[\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"]'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother (simplified) workaround is to set `json_loads`. but its not very elegant since `json_loads` doesn't know what field its is parsing, which could be error prone:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport json\r\nimport os\r\nfrom typing import List\r\n\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseSettings, BaseModel, root_validator\r\n\r\nos.environ['options'] = \"a,b,c\"\r\n    \r\ndef list_parse_fallback(v):\r\n    try:\r\n        return json.loads(v)\r\n    except Exception as e:\r\n        return v.split(\",\")\r\n\r\nclass Settings(BaseSettings):\r\n    options: List\r\n        \r\n    class Config:\r\n        json_loads = list_parse_fallback\r\n       \r\ns = Settings()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can see a couple options for implementing the fix:\r\n\r\n### 1. Store the parsing method in the field info extra:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nparse_func = lambda x: x.split(\",\")\r\n\r\nclass Settings(BaseSettings):\r\n    options: List = Field(..., env_parse=parse_func)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we take this approach, I think that we can update this logic branch:\r\nhttps://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/blob/42395056e18dfaa3ef299373374ab3b12bb196ac/pydantic/env_settings.py#L170-L174\r\n\r\nAdding something like the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif field.is_complex():\r\n    if field.extra.get(\"env_parse\", None) is not None:\r\n        try:\r\n            env_val = field.extra[\"env_parse\"](env_val)  # type: ignore\r\n        except ValueError as e:\r\n            raise SettingsError(f'error with custom parsing function for \"{env_name}\"') from e\r\n    else:\r\n        try:\r\n            env_val = self.__config__.json_loads(env_val)  # type: ignore\r\n        except ValueError as e:\r\n            raise SettingsError(f'error parsing JSON for \"{env_name}\"') from e\r\nd[field.alias] = env_val\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Add a new config option just for Settings for overriding how env vars are parsed\r\nAnother implementation option is to add a new property like `Settings.Config.parse_env_var` which takes the `field` and the value so that it can be overridden to handle dispatching to different parsing methods for different names/properties of `field` (currently, just overriding `json_loads` means you are passed a value without knowing where it will be stored so you have to test for and handle all of the possible settings values.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass BaseSettings:\r\n    ...\r\n    class Config:\r\n         ...\r\n        @classmethod\r\n        def parse_env_var(cls, field, raw_val):\r\n            return cls.json_loads(raw_val)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the following line is the only change that is needed:\r\nhttps://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/blob/master/pydantic/env_settings.py#L62\r\n\r\nChanges to `self.__config__.parse_env_var(field, env_val)`\r\n\r\n\r\n### 3. Call field validators on the raw string instead of trying to load from json first\r\n\r\nChange the same line to:\r\n```\r\nenv_val, ee = field.validate(env_val)\r\n\r\n# collect ee and raise errors\r\n```\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n - Adding validators for fields is well documented / understood\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n - Breaks existing JSON functionality if those fields already have validators\r\n - Mixes up the abstractions in that the functions would now do parsing and validation\r\n\r\n### 4. Custom (de)serialization\r\n\r\nLet fields implement custom serialization/deserialization methods. Currently there is `json_encoders` but not an equivalent `json_decoders` for use per-field.\r\n\r\nThere's some discussion of this here: https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/951\r\n\r\n### 5. Something else\r\n\r\nOther ideas? Happy to implement a different suggestion.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nOutput of `python -c \"import pydantic.utils; print(pydantic.utils.version_info())\"`:\r\n```\r\n             pydantic version: 1.5.1\r\n            pydantic compiled: True\r\n                 install path: /Users/bull/miniconda3/envs/sandbox/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pydantic\r\n               python version: 3.7.6 (default, Jan  8 2020, 13:42:34)  [Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)]\r\n                     platform: Darwin-19.4.0-x86_64-i386-64bit\r\n     optional deps. installed: []\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /pydantic)\nbash-$"
