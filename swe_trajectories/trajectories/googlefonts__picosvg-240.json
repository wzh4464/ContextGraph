Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\n  signature: edit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit\n  arguments:\n    - start_line (integer) [required]: the line number to start the edit at\n    - end_line (integer) [required]: the line number to end the edit at (inclusive)\n    - replacement_text (string) [required]: the text to replace the current selection with\n\n\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\nIf you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code!

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nFailed to extract translation\n.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/picosvg/svg_transform.py\", line 339, in decompose_translation\r\n    ), f\"Failed to extract translation from {self}, parts compose back to {test_compose}\"\r\nAssertionError: Failed to extract translation from Affine2D(a=-4.382842e-08, b=1.0027, c=-4.2262, d=-1.847346e-07, e=1133.4812, f=889.4797), parts compose back to Affine2D(a=-4.382842e-08, b=1.0027, c=-4.2262, d=-1.847346e-07, e=1133.4812, f=889.4796970082031)\r\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /picosvg)\nbash-$"

      "text": "We have the `svg_transform.py` file open and are looking at the `decompose_translation` method, which is where the issue occurs. The error message in the issue suggests that there's a problem with extracting the translation components of an affine transformation, and that the parts compose back to a different Affine2D than expected.\n\nThe code in this method seems to correctly extract the translation components using a matrix inversion technique. However, the assertion at line 341 fails, indicating that the computed translation does not match the expected translation when composed with the original affine.\n\nTo address this, we should investigate the logic and accuracy of the translation extraction process, particularly around the matrix inversion and composition steps. We may need to adjust the logic to handle cases where the translation components are not being extracted correctly.\n\nLet's start by reviewing the key steps in the `decompose_translation` method to ensure that the translation components are being extracted and composed correctly.\n\n1. Matrix inversion: The original affine transformation matrix is modified to zero out the translation components.\n2. Calculation of translation components: The translation components are calculated based on the modified matrix.\n3. Composition check: The translated affine transformation is composed with the original affine transformation to check if the translation is correct.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, it might be helpful to add some debug output to see the actual values being used in the translation calculation and composition steps. This can aid in identifying any discrepancies or inaccuracies.\n\nFirst, let's make a small edit to add debug output to the `decompose_translation` method. We'll print the values of `x_prime` and `y_prime`, which are the calculated translation components, as well as the final composed transformation `test_compose`, just before the assertion. This will help us verify the values and confirm whether they match the expected translation.\n\n```\nedit 333:333\n            print(f\"x_prime: {x_prime}, y_prime: {y_prime}, test_compose: {test_compose}\")\nend_of_edit\n```"
