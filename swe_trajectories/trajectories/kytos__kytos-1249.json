Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nKytos running in background only stop after two pkill\nHi, even though this seems to be similar to #1236 and #1235, I've decided to create this new issue because it just started happening after PR #1231. The problem is: when you start kytos in the background, you have to issue pkill kytos twice before be able to stop the process. \r\n\r\nThis only happens to me if I install kytos from master branch. The pre-release 2021.1rc1 don't includes this bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Run kytos base docker image: `docker run -d --name k3 kytos/base:latest tail -f /dev/null`\r\n2. Install the basic kytos packages:\r\n```\r\npython3.6 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\r\npython3.6 -m pip install https://github.com/kytos/python-openflow/archive/master.zip\r\npython3.6 -m pip install https://github.com/kytos/kytos-utils/archive/master.zip\r\npython3.6 -m pip install https://github.com/kytos/kytos/archive/master.zip\r\n```\r\n3. Start kytos in background: `kytosd`\r\n4. Try to shutdown kytos: `pkill kytosd`\r\n\r\nExpected result: kytos should be shutdown\r\n\r\nActual result: kytos remains running\r\n\r\nIf I revert PR #1231, the issue stops happening. So, looks like some internal command is using the shutdown API endpoint but does not fit the authenticated decorator. For example the stop_api_server() ( https://github.com/kytos/kytos/blob/master/kytos/core/api_server.py#L148) which is called by kytos.controller.stop_controller() (https://github.com/kytos/kytos/blob/master/kytos/core/controller.py#L399)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /kytos)\nbash-$"

The issue describes a problem with the shutdown API endpoint, and the code suggests that there is an endpoint `/api/kytos/core/shutdown` that is meant to shut down the API server. The issue seems to be that this endpoint is not working as expected, and the user has to issue `pkill kytosd` twice to stop the process.\n\nLooking at the code, we can see a `stop_api_server` method that sends a shutdown request to the API server. However, it looks like there may be an issue with the way it's sending the request, or the request is not being handled correctly by the `shutdown_api` method.\n\nTo address this, we should ensure that the `stop_api_server` method is correctly sending the shutdown request and that the `shutdown_api` method is properly handling the request to shut down the API server.\n\nLet's start by examining the `stop_api_server` method to ensure that it is sending the request correctly. We should check that the URL is being formed correctly and that the request is being sent appropriately.\n\nWe will then move on to the `shutdown_api` method to ensure that it is handling the shutdown request correctly. This will involve checking that the method is shutting down the server in response to the request.\n\nFirst, let's examine the `stop_api_server` method. We are already at the correct location in the file, so we can proceed with checking the code.\n\nThe try-except block in `stop_api_server` indicates that it's expecting a URL to be opened, and if a `URLError` occurs, it will silently fail. This seems problematic for a shutdown operation, as we would want to know if the request failed.\n\nTo improve this, we should add a message indicating that the shutdown request has been sent, and also add a message in the except block to indicate that the request failed. This will help in debugging.\n\nLet's start by modifying the `stop_api_server` method to include these messages.\n\n```\nedit 148:154\n    def stop_api_server(self):\n        \"\"\"Send a shutdown request to stop Api Server.\"\"\"\n        try:\n            url = f'http://127.0.0.1:{self.port}/api/kytos/core/shutdown'\n            urlopen(url)\n            print(\"Shutdown request sent successfully.\")\n        except URLError:\n            print(\"Failed to send shutdown request.\")\nend_of_edit\n```"
