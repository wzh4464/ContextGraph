Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed.

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "text": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nWsgiToAsgi should stop sending response body after content-length bytes\nHi,\r\n\r\nI was having issues when serving partial requests (using Range headers) from [whitenoise](https://github.com/evansd/whitenoise) wrapped in WsgiToAsgi. Some HTTP and ASGI servers in front of that complained about extra content in the response body (I've had the issue with traefik in front of uvicorn and with [uvicorn itself when using the httptools protocol handler](https://github.com/encode/uvicorn/blob/master/uvicorn/protocols/http/httptools_impl.py#L517)).\r\n\r\nOne contributing factor is whitenoise which returns the file handle to the whole file in a [wsgiref.FileWrapper](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/wsgiref/util.py#L11), seeked to the correct position for the range request. It then expects the server to only read as many bytes as defined in the Content-Length header.\r\n\r\nThe [WSGI specs allows for this behavior](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/#handling-the-content-length-header) and [gunicorn implements it](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/blob/master/gunicorn/http/wsgi.py#L333) and stops reading after as many bytes as specified in Content-Length.\r\n\r\nThe [ASGI spec](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specs/www.html#http) does not say much about the consistency between Content-Length header and the \"http.response.body\" events. The relevant parts could be :\r\n> Protocol servers must flush any data passed to them into the send buffer before returning from a send call.\r\n\r\n> Yielding content from the WSGI application maps to sending http.response.body messages.\r\n\r\nThe first one suggests that any piece of body from an \"http.response.body\" event must be sent, the other one could mean that all behavior defined for WSGI should apply to ASGI, including not-sending extra body, maybe ?\r\n\r\n[uvicorn](https://github.com/encode/uvicorn/blob/master/uvicorn/protocols/http/h11_impl.py#L475), [daphe](https://github.com/django/daphne/blob/master/daphne/http_protocol.py#L255) and [hypercorn](https://gitlab.com/pgjones/hypercorn/-/blob/master/src/hypercorn/protocol/http_stream.py#L147) lean more towards the first interpretation and pass through the whole readable content or simply raise an exception.\r\n\r\nIf you agree that the WsgiToAsgi adapter should clamp the body I can work on a patch.\r\n\r\nAside from this, the ASGI spec could probably be improved by defining this point. I don't really know if ASGI servers should prefer clamping or forwarding extra body responses but I have the vague feeling that allowing ASGI events to generate incorrectly framed HTTP messages could generate hard to diagnose issues in the future without providing any benefit.\r\n\r\nIf the sendfile extension from #184 is added, the same point will probably arise, it would be very inconvenient to only be able to use sendfile when serving whole files. WSGI also specifies the clamping behavior [when using sendfile](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/#optional-platform-specific-file-handling) and [gunicorn](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/blob/master/gunicorn/http/wsgi.py#L365) implements it.\r\n\r\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /asgiref)\nbash-$"
