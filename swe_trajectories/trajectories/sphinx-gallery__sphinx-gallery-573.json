If line_number is provided, the window will be move to include that line\n  signature: open <path> [<line_number>]\n  arguments:\n    - path (string) [required]: the path to the file to open\n    - line_number (integer) [optional]: the line number to move the window to (if not provided, the window will start at the top of the file)\n\ngoto:\n  docstring: moves the window to show <line_number>\n  signature: goto <line_number>\n  arguments:\n    - line_number (integer) [required]: the line number to move the window to\n\nscroll_down:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_down\n\nscroll_up:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_up\n\ncreate:\n  docstring: creates and opens a new file with the given name\n  signature: create <filename>\n  arguments:\n    - filename (string) [required]: the name of the file to create\n\nsubmit:\n  docstring: submits your current code and terminates the session\n  signature: submit\n\nsearch_dir:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in all files in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: search_dir <search_term> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nsearch_file:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in file. If file is not provided, searches in the current open file\n  signature: search_file <search_term> [<file>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - file (string) [optional]: the file to search in (if not provided, searches in the current open file)\n\nfind_file:\n  docstring: finds all files with the given name in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: find_file <file_name> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - file_name (string) [required]: the name of the file to search for\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nedit:\n  docstring: replaces lines <start_line> through <end_line> (inclusive) with the given text in the open file. The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\n  signature: edit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit\n  arguments:\n    - start_line (integer) [required]: the line number to start the edit at\n    - end_line (integer) [required]: the line number to end the edit at (inclusive)\n    - replacement_text (string) [required]: the text to replace the current selection with\n\n\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\nIf you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "text": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nRemove the note linking to the download section at the beginning of the example from latex/pdf output\nFor latex/pdf output, this note at the beginning of the example linking to the download section does not link to anything (since there are no download buttons). Would it be possible to disable it in that case? The straightforward way would be wrap it into a `.. only:: html` directive.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sphinx-gallery)\nbash-$"

For information on how\n83:  to structure these Python scripts with embedded rST, see\n84:  :ref:`python_script_syntax`.\n85:\n86:    * By default **only** files prefixed with ``plot_`` will be executed and\n87:      their outputs captured to incorporate them in the HTML (or another output\n88:      format depending on the `Sphinx 'builder'\n89:      <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-build.html>`_ selected)\n90:      output of the script. Files without that prefix will be only parsed and\n91:      presented in a rich literate programming fashion, without any output. To\n92:      change the default pattern for execution and capture see\n93:      :ref:`build_pattern`.\n94:    * The output that is captured while executing the ``.py`` files and\n95:      subsequently incorporated into the built documentation can be finely\n96:      tuned. See :ref:`capture_repr`.\n97:    * You can have sub-directories in your ``examples`` directory. These will be\n98:      included as sub-sections of your gallery. They **must** contain their own\n99:      ``README.txt`` or ``README.rst`` file as well.\n100:\n(100 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /sphinx-gallery/doc/getting_started.rst)\n(Current directory: /sphinx-gallery)\nbash-$"

It must begin by defining a rST title. The title\n17:   may contain any punctuation mark but cannot start with the same punctuation\n18:   mark repeated more than 3 times. For example::\n19:\n20:    \"\"\"\n21:    \"This\" is my example-script\n22:    ===========================\n23:\n24:    This example doesn't do much, it just makes a simple plot\n25:    \"\"\"\n26:2. **Python code**. This can be any valid Python code that you wish. Any\n27:   Matplotlib images that are generated will be saved to disk, and\n28:   the rST generated will display these images with the built examples. By\n29:   default only images generated by Matplotlib, or packages based on Matplotlib\n30:   (e.g., Seaborn or Yellowbrick) are saved and displayed. However, you can\n31:   change this to include other packages, see :ref:`image_scrapers`.\n32:\n33:For a quick reference have a look at the example\n34::ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_0_sin.py`\n35:\n36:.. _embedding_rst:\n37:\n38:Embed rST in your example Python files\n39:======================================\n40:\n41:Additionally, you may embed rST syntax within your Python scripts. This will\n42:be rendered in-line with the Python code and its outputs, similar to how\n43:Jupyter Notebooks are structured (in fact, Sphinx-Gallery also **creates** a\n44:Jupyter Notebook for each example that is built).\n45:\n46:You can embed rST in your Python examples by including a line of  >= 20 ``#``\n47:symbols or ``#%%``. For compatibility reasons, ``# %%`` (with a space) can also\n48:be used but ``#%%`` is recommended for consistency. If using ``#``'s, we\n49:recommend using 79 ``#``'s, like this::\n50:\n51:  ###############################################################################\n52:\n53:Any commented lines (a line beginning with ``#`` and a space so they are\n54:PEP8-compliant) that immediately follow will be rendered as rST in the built\n55:gallery examples. For example::\n56:\n57:  # This is commented python\n58:  myvariable = 2\n59:  print(\"my variable is {}\".format(myvariable))\n60:\n61:  ###############################################################################\n62:  # This is a section header\n63:  # ------------------------\n64:  #\n65:  # In the built documentation, it will be rendered as rST.\n66:\n67:  # These lines won't be rendered as rST because there is a gap after the last\n68:  # commented rST block. Instead, they'll resolve as regular Python comments.\n69:  print('my variable plus 2 is {}'.format(myvariable + 2))\n70:\n71:The ``#%%`` syntax is consistent with the 'code block' (or 'code cell')\n72:syntax in `Jupyter VSCode plugin\n73:<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support>`_, `Jupytext\n74:<https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html>`_, `Pycharm\n75:<https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/running-jupyter-notebook-cells.html>`_, \n76:`Hydrogen plugin (for Atom)\n77:<https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/>`_ and `Spyder\n78:<https://docs.spyder-ide.org/editor.html>`_. In these IDEs/with these IDE \n79:plugins, ``#%%`` at the start of a line signifies the start of a code block. \n80:The code within a code block can be easily executed all at once. This \n81:functionality can be helpful when writing a Sphinx-Gallery ``.py`` script.\n82:\n83:Here are the contents of an example Python file using the 'code block' \n84:functionality::\n85:\n86:  \"\"\"\n87:  This is my example script\n88:  =========================\n89:\n90:  This example doesn't do much, it just makes a simple plot\n91:  \"\"\"\n92:\n93:  #%%\n94:  # This is a section header\n95:  # ------------------------\n96:  # This is the first section!\n97:  # The `#%%` signifies to Sphinx-Gallery that this text should be rendered as\n98:  # rST and if using one of the above IDE/plugin's, also signifies the start of a \n99:  # 'code block'.\n100:\n(18 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /sphinx-gallery/doc/syntax.rst)\n(Current directory: /sphinx-gallery)\nbash-$"
