Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly.

Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "text": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nSetting explicit Content-Type header in addition to json body results in comma-delimited Content-Type\n### Describe the bug\n\nWhen passing a JSON payload to a response object as `json=...`, the content-type is automatically set to `application/json`.\r\nAttempting to set Content-Type explicitly results in a malformed header, with the content-type values comma-separated.\n\n### Additional context\n\nExplicitly setting `Content-Type: application/json` causes this, but is easily rectified by removing that value and relying on `json=...`.\r\nHowever, setting a specialized JSON media type is not supported via this path, e.g. `application/custom+json; my-parameter`.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to work around this today by using `body=...` and avoiding `json=...` entirely, but this violates the principle of least-surprise. One would expect a valid Content-Type to come out of the combination of `json=..., headers=...`.\n\n### Version of `responses`\n\n0.23.1\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n```python\r\nimport requests\r\nimport responses\r\n\r\nresponses.add(\r\n    responses.GET,\r\n    \"https://example.org/\",\r\n    json={},\r\n    headers={\"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"},\r\n)\r\nresponses.start()\r\n\r\nr = requests.get(\"https://example.org/\")\r\nprint(r.headers.get(\"Content-Type\"))  # \"application/json, application/json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis happens with any Content-Type value, not only the JSON one. e.g. Setting `Content-Type: foo` results in `application/json, foo`.\n\n### Expected Result\n\nContent-Type should only ever have a single value, although some HTTP client implementations attempt to parse it as a list for broader compatibility with malformed data. ([Relevant section of RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#field.content-type).)\r\n\r\nThere are various behaviors which could be chosen here. e.g. Any match for `application/.*\\+json;.*` could be used as a replacement, but headers could be otherwise concatenated.\r\n\r\nHowever, the least surprising behavior would be for the explicit `Content-Type` header to _always_ override the implicit one from `json=...`.\n\n### Actual Result\n\nContent-Type header values are comma-joined, producing a header which does not consistently parse as JSON depending on the mimetype detection algorithm used.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /responses)\nbash-$"

The issue describes that when we pass a JSON payload to a response object as `json=...`, the content-type is automatically set to `application/json`. Attempting to set the `Content-Type` explicitly results in a malformed header, with the content-type values comma-separated. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the explicit `Content-Type` header overwrites the implicit one set by `json=...`. Let's examine the code where the headers are set to see how we can fix this problem. We should look for the code that handles the `json` parameter and the `Content-Type` header. Since we have the `add` method located, we should search nearby to see where the response and headers are processed.\n\nLet's scroll down to see more of the code that follows the `add` method to see if it contains the logic we need to edit.\n```\nscroll_down\n```"

The issue suggests that we should ensure that the `Content-Type` header provided explicitly in the `headers` parameter overrides the `content_type` set by the `json` parameter. To fix this issue, we need to modify the code where the headers are set to ensure that the explicit `Content-Type` header takes precedence. \n\nLet's examine the code where the `content_type` and `headers` are set to see how we can fix this problem. We should look for the code that handles the `json` parameter and the `Content-Type` header. Since we have the `Response` class located, we should search within this class to see where the response and headers are processed.\n\nLet's scroll up to see more of the code within the `Response` class to see if it contains the logic we need to edit.\n```\nscroll_up\n```"
