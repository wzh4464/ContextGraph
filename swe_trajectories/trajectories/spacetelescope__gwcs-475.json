If line_number is provided, the window will be move to include that line\n  signature: open <path> [<line_number>]\n  arguments:\n    - path (string) [required]: the path to the file to open\n    - line_number (integer) [optional]: the line number to move the window to (if not provided, the window will start at the top of the file)\n\ngoto:\n  docstring: moves the window to show <line_number>\n  signature: goto <line_number>\n  arguments:\n    - line_number (integer) [required]: the line number to move the window to\n\nscroll_down:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_down\n\nscroll_up:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_up\n\ncreate:\n  docstring: creates and opens a new file with the given name\n  signature: create <filename>\n  arguments:\n    - filename (string) [required]: the name of the file to create\n\nsubmit:\n  docstring: submits your current code and terminates the session\n  signature: submit\n\nsearch_dir:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in all files in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: search_dir <search_term> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nsearch_file:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in file. If file is not provided, searches in the current open file\n  signature: search_file <search_term> [<file>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - file (string) [optional]: the file to search in (if not provided, searches in the current open file)\n\nfind_file:\n  docstring: finds all files with the given name in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: find_file <file_name> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - file_name (string) [required]: the name of the file to search for\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nedit:\n  docstring: replaces lines <start_line> through <end_line> (inclusive) with the given text in the open file. The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\n  signature: edit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit\n  arguments:\n    - start_line (integer) [required]: the line number to start the edit at\n    - end_line (integer) [required]: the line number to end the edit at (inclusive)\n    - replacement_text (string) [required]: the text to replace the current selection with\n\n\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\nIf you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "text": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nConsider adding a description in the docs about manifest changes in #469\nAs brought up in this comment:\r\nhttps://github.com/spacetelescope/jdaviz/issues/2446#issuecomment-1716413809\r\n\r\nUsers opening files generated with gwcs prior to the fix included in #469 will see warnings like the following:\r\n```\r\nasdf.exceptions.AsdfWarning: File was created with extension URI 'asdf://asdf-format.org/astronomy/gwcs/extensions/gwcs-1.0.0' (from package gwcs==0.18.2), which is not currently installed \r\n```\r\nDue to `1.0.0` no longer being registered as an extension. As `1.0.1` and `1.1.0` cover all tags from `1.0.0` it is safe to ignore this warning but this nuance will likely be unknown to gwcs users.\r\n\r\nOne option would be to update the documentation and release notes describing the issue and can be ignored until the file can e regenerate (which will get rid of the warning).\r\n\r\nI'm also open to suggestions on other ways to handle this (including possibly registering a 'dummy' `1.0.0` extension which does nothing yet should hide the warning). @nden @eslavich do you think this is worth investigating as an option?\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /gwcs)\nbash-$"

Images and\n14:other types of data often come encoded with information that describes this mapping – this is referred\n15:to as the ‘World Coordinate System’ or WCS. The term WCS is often used to refer specifically\n16:to the most widely used 'FITS implementation of WCS', but here unless specified WCS refers to\n17:the broader concept of relating pixel ⟷ world. (See the discussion in `APE14 <https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/master/APE14.rst#backgroundterminology>`__\n18:for more on this topic).\n19:\n20:The FITS WCS standard, currently the most widely used method of encoding WCS in data, describes a\n21:set of required FITS header keywords and allowed values that describe how pixel ⟷ world transformations\n22:should be done. This current paradigm of encoding data with only instructions on how to relate pixel to world, separate\n23:from the transformation machinery itself, has several limitations:\n24:\n25:* Limited flexibility. WCS keywords and their values are rigidly defined so that the instructions are unambiguous.\n26:  This places limitations on, for example, describing geometric distortion in images since only a handful of distortion models are defined\n27:  in the FITS standard (and therefore can be encoded in FITS headers as WCS information).\n28:* Separation of data from transformation pipelines. The machinery that transforms pixel ⟷ world\n29:  does not exist along side the data – there is merely a roadmap for how one *would* do the transformation.\n30:  External packages and libraries (e.g wcslib, or its Python interface astropy.wcs) must be\n31:  written to interpret the instructions and execute the transformation. These libraries\n32:  don’t allow easy access to coordinate frames along the course of the full pixel to world\n33:  transformation pipeline. Additionally, since these libraries can only interpret FITS WCS\n34:  information, any custom ‘WCS’ definitions outside of FITS require the user to write their own transformation pipelines.\n35:* Incompatibility with varying file formats. New file formats that are becoming more widely\n36:  used in place of FITS to store astronomical data, like the ASDF format, also require a\n37:  method of encoding WCS information. FITS WCS and the accompanying libraries are adapted for\n38:  FITS only. A more flexible interface would be agnostic to file type, as long as the necessary\n39:  information is present.\n40:\n41:The `GWCS <https://github.com/spacetelescope/gwcs>`__ package and GWCS object is a generalized WCS\n42:implementation that mitigates these limitations. The goal of the GWCS package is to provide a\n43:flexible toolkit for expressing and evaluating transformations between pixel and world coordinates,\n44:as well as intermediate frames along the course of this transformation.The GWCS object supports a\n45:data model which includes the entire transformation pipeline from input pixel coordinates to\n46:world coordinates (and vice versa). The basis of the GWCS object is astropy `modeling <https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/modeling/>`__.\n47:Models that describe the pixel ⟷ world transformations can be chained, joined or combined with arithmetic operators\n48:using the flexible framework of compound models in modeling. This approach allows for easy\n49:access to intermediate frames. In the case of a celestial output frame `coordinates <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/>`__ provides further transformations between\n50:standard celestial coordinate frames. Spectral output coordinates are instances of `~astropy.units.Quantity`\n51:and can be transformed to other units with the tools in that package. `~astropy.time.Time` coordinates are instances of `~astropy.time.Time`.\n52:GWCS supports transforms initialized with `~astropy.units.Quantity`\n53:objects ensuring automatic unit conversion.\n54:\n55:Pixel Conventions and Definitions\n56:---------------------------------\n57:\n58:This API assumes that integer pixel values fall at the center of pixels (as\n59:assumed in the FITS-WCS standard, see Section 2.1.4 of `Greisen et al., 2002,\n60:A&A 446, 747 <https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20053818>`_), while at the same\n61:time matching the Python 0-index philosophy.  That is, the first pixel is\n62:considered pixel ``0``, but pixel coordinates ``(0, 0)`` are the *center* of\n63:that pixel.  Hence the first pixel spans pixel values ``-0.5`` to ``0.5``.\n64:\n65:There are two main conventions for ordering pixel coordinates. In the context of\n66:2-dimensional imaging data/arrays, one can either think of the pixel coordinates\n67:as traditional Cartesian coordinates (which we call ``x`` and ``y`` here), which\n68:are usually given with the horizontal coordinate (``x``) first, and the vertical\n69:coordinate (``y``) second, meaning that pixel coordinates would be given as\n70:``(x, y)``. Alternatively, one can give the coordinates by first giving the row\n71:in the data, then the column, i.e. ``(row, column)``. While the former is a more\n72:common convention when e.g. plotting (think for example of the Matplotlib\n73:``scatter(x, y)`` method), the latter is the convention used when accessing\n74:values from e.g. Numpy arrays that represent images (``image[row, column]``).\n75:\n76:The GWCS object assumes Cartesian order ``(x, y)``, however the :ref:`ape14` accepts both conventions.\n77:The order of the pixel coordinates (``(x, y)`` vs ``(row, column)``) in the ``Common API`` depends on the method or property used, and this can normally be\n78:determined from the property or method name. Properties and methods containing\n79:``pixel`` assume ``(x, y)`` ordering, while properties and methods containing\n80:``array`` assume ``(row, column)`` ordering.\n81:\n82:Installation\n83:------------\n84:\n85:`gwcs <https://github.com/spacetelescope/gwcs>`__ requires:\n86:\n87:- `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`__\n88:\n89:- `astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`__\n90:\n91:- `asdf <https://asdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__\n92:\n93:To install from source::\n94:\n95:    git clone https://github.com/spacetelescope/gwcs.git\n96:    cd gwcs\n97:    python setup.py install\n98:\n99:To install the latest release::\n100:\n(237 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /gwcs/docs/index.rst)\n(Current directory: /gwcs)\nbash-$"

GWCS uses a manifest to describe the WCS information. Changes to the manifest can cause warnings when opening files created with an older version of the manifest.\n+\n+One such change occurred in GWCS version 0.10, where the `gwcs/wcs-1.0.0` manifest was updated to `gwcs/wcs-1.0.1`. This change can cause a warning when opening files created with the older `gwcs/wcs-1.0.0` manifest.\n+\n+The warning is harmless and can be ignored. However, if you want to get rid of the warning, you can update the manifest in your file to the new version. You can do this by opening the file and then saving it again with the new manifest.\n+\n+Let's proceed by adding a new section to describe how to update the manifest. We'll add a new file `update_manifest.rst` to the `docs/gwcs` directory and include it in the toctree.\ndiff --git a/docs/gwcs/update_manifest.rst b/docs/gwcs/update_manifest.rst\nnew file mode 100644\nindex 0000000..8dc96f1\n--- /dev/null\n+++ b/docs/gwcs/update_manifest.rst\n@@ -0,0 +1,10 @@\n+How to Update the Manifest\n+--------------------------\n+\n+To update the manifest in your file to the new version, you can open the file and then save it again with the new manifest.
