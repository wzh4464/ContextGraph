      "text": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nui: what should `--quiet` do for tabular outputs?\nWhat does the `--quiet` mean for our DVC commands? \r\n\r\nIt can have two different meanings:\r\n1. Don't show up verbose error messages, but show messages that do matter (important warnings + what the user has asked for).\r\n2. Display nothing at all.\r\n\r\nI have seen a few tools using `--silent` instead for 2). But, I guess the most important thing is being consistent here.\r\n\r\nThe following are the ones that do print on `--quiet`:\r\n1. `stage list`\r\n2. `exp show`\r\n3. `completion`\r\n4. `remote default`\r\n\r\nOther commands such as `metrics/params/plots` don't show anything at all (what's the use here of `--quiet`?).\r\n\r\nP.S. What should `dvc repro` and `dvc exp run` do?\nmetrics show/diff: UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\\u2014'\n# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nI have an encoding error on one of the remote server I use. I think it is linked to the default encoding which is configured on this machine. But I wanted to raise this issue just in case you didn't know that for some particular configuration, displaying metrics can fail. The problematic character is `—`, which is used when a metric value is missing. For the same project, `dvc metrics show` and `dvc metrics diff` display it normally on my local dev machine but on the remote server it fails with the encoding error.\r\n\r\n### Reproduce\r\n\r\nBasically, take a machine (or a docker container, see the image I used in the next section) with ascii encoding being used for the console and run `dvc metrics show` or `dvc metrics diff` in a context in which a metric value is missing.\r\n\r\nFor instance, make two metric files with different metric names. If you run `dvc metrics show`, it will try to display something like this:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n                                 Metric Name 1     Metric Name 2\r\nmetric_file_1.json               0.15833           —          \r\nmetric_file_2.json               —                 0.98103\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the default encoding is ascii, this will fail.\r\n\r\n### Expected\r\n\r\nI would expect the command to work in all contexts. For instance, the `—` character could be replaced with `-` or `NA` if it cannot be displayed.\r\n\r\n### Environment information\r\nI run my code in a docker container based on `nvidia/cuda:10.0-cudnn7-devel-ubuntu16.04`\r\n\r\n**Output of `dvc doctor`:**\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ dvc doctor\r\nDVC version: 2.0.3 (pip)\r\n---------------------------------\r\nPlatform: Python 3.6.12 on Linux-3.10.0-1160.11.1.el7.x86_64-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nSupports: hdfs, http, https, ssh\r\nCache types: hardlink, symlink\r\nCache directory: overlay on overlay\r\nCaches: local\r\nRemotes: ssh\r\nWorkspace directory: overlay on overlay\r\nRepo: dvc, git\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional Information (if any):**\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ dvc metrics show --verbose\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/envs/my-env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/dvc/logger.py\", line 136, in emit\r\n    msg, file=self.stream, end=getattr(self, \"terminator\", \"\\n\")\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/envs/my-env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tqdm/std.py\", line 619, in write\r\n    fp.write(s)\r\nUnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\\u2014' in position 301: ordinal not in range(128)\r\n\r\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/envs/my-env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/dvc/main.py\", line 50, in main\r\n    ret = cmd.run()\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/envs/my-env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/dvc/command/metrics.py\", line 100, in run\r\n    logger.info(table)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/envs/my-env/lib/python3.6/logging/__init__.py\", line 1308, in info\r\n    self._log(INFO, msg, args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/envs/my-env/lib/python3.6/logging/__init__.py\", line 1444, in _log\r\n    self.handle(record)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/envs/my-env/lib/python3.6/logging/__init__.py\", line 1454, in handle\r\n    self.callHandlers(record)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/envs/my-env/lib/python3.6/logging/__init__.py\", line 1516, in callHandlers\r\n    hdlr.handle(record)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/envs/my-env/lib/python3.6/logging/__init__.py\", line 865, in handle\r\n    self.emit(record)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/envs/my-env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/dvc/logger.py\", line 142, in emit\r\n    self.handleError(record)\r\n  File \"/opt/conda/envs/my-env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/dvc/logger.py\", line 129, in handleError\r\n    raise LoggingException(record)\r\ndvc.logger.LoggingException: failed to log <LogRecord: dvc.command.metrics, 20, /opt/conda/envs/my-env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/dvc/command/metrics.py, 100\r\n```\r\n\r\nI cannot show the whole log because it contains confidential metrics but I think that with these information you will be able to understand where is the issue in the code of DVC. Otherwise, don't hesitate to ask me :wink: \n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /dvc)\nbash-$"
