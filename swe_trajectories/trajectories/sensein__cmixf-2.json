The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly.

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "text": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nfix corner cases that depend on ordering of tokens\nthe use of sly makes tokenizing dependent on order of tokens. this results in a set of units to be not parsed correctly.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sensein/cmixf/blob/master/cmixf/tests/test_cmixf.py#L84\r\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /cmixf)\nbash-$"

      "text": "We have the `CMIXFLexer` and `CMIXFParser` classes in the `parser.py` file. The `CMIXFLexer` class defines the tokens and rules for tokenizing the input string, while the `CMIXFParser` class defines the grammar and parsing rules. The issue suggests that there is a problem with the tokenizing order, which is handled by the `CMIXFLexer` class. We should look at the tokenizing rules in the `CMIXFLexer` class to see where the order dependency might be occurring.\n\nThe `CMIXFLexer` class uses regular expressions to match different token types. The issue might be related to how the regular expressions are ordered or how the `sly` library processes them. We should check for any ambiguous or conflicting regular expressions that might be causing the issue.\n\nLet's start by checking the regular expressions for the `UNITB`, `UNITN`, and `UNITP` tokens, as these seem to be the ones involved in the test case that is failing (\"1mol/m^3\"). We can see the regular expressions for these tokens near the beginning of the `CMIXFLexer` class definition. `UNITB` is defined as `r\"([A-Z][A-Z][A-Z]|A|Bq|C|F|Gy|H|Hz|J|K|N|Ohm|Pa|Sv|S|T|V|W|Wb|bit|cd|eV|g|kat|lm|lx|mol|m|s)\"`, `UNITN` as `r\"(L|Np|oC|o|rad|sr)\"`, and `UNITP` as `r\"(Bd|B|r|t)\"`. These regular expressions look correct, but the issue might be in how they are applied or prioritized during tokenization.\n\nTo further investigate, we should run the `CMIXFLexer` on the test case string to see how it tokenizes it. This will help identify if the issue is with the regular expressions or with the order in which they are matched. Let's create a script to test the `CMIXFLexer` with the string `\"1mol/m^3\"`.

The issue we are facing is related to the order in which the tokens are matched, which is affecting the parsing of certain units like \"mol\".\n\nThe regular expression matcher is likely matching the \"mo\" substring first, instead of the full \"mol\" unit. We need to ensure that the \"mol\" unit is matched before the \"mo\" substring. This can be done by adjusting the regular expressions or the order in which they are applied.\n\nLet's examine the `_master_re` variable to see how the regular expressions are combined and applied.

The matcher uses the `match` function, which searches for the regular expression patterns in the order they are provided. To ensure that \"mol\" is matched before \"mo\", we need to adjust the order of the patterns in the `_master_re` regular expression.\n\nWe will need to modify the `_master_re` regular expression to prioritize the \"mol\" pattern over the \"mo\" pattern. Since the `_master_re` variable is initialized in the `tokenize` method, we will need to modify the regular expressions before they are combined into `_master_re`. These regular expressions are likely to be found in the `CMIXFLexer` class, which provides the token patterns.\n\nLet's go back to the `CMIXFLexer` class in the `cmixf/parser.py` file and look at the regular expression patterns for the `UNITB` and `UNITN` tokens. We need to ensure that the \"mol\" pattern is included in `UNITB` and is given priority over the \"mo\" pattern in `UNITN`. We will use the `open` command to go back to the `parser.py` file.\n```\nopen cmixf/parser.py\n```"

Since we can't directly control the `_master_re` ordering here, the safer option is to modify the `UNITN` pattern to exclude \"mol\". \n\nWe'll edit the `UNITN` pattern to replace \"mo\" with \"(?!mol)mo\", which is a negative lookahead assertion that will prevent \"mo\" from matching if it's followed by \"l\".
