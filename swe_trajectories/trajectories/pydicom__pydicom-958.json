If line_number is provided, the window will be move to include that line\n  signature: open <path> [<line_number>]\n  arguments:\n    - path (string) [required]: the path to the file to open\n    - line_number (integer) [optional]: the line number to move the window to (if not provided, the window will start at the top of the file)\n\ngoto:\n  docstring: moves the window to show <line_number>\n  signature: goto <line_number>\n  arguments:\n    - line_number (integer) [required]: the line number to move the window to\n\nscroll_down:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_down\n\nscroll_up:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_up\n\ncreate:\n  docstring: creates and opens a new file with the given name\n  signature: create <filename>\n  arguments:\n    - filename (string) [required]: the name of the file to create\n\nsubmit:\n  docstring: submits your current code and terminates the session\n  signature: submit\n\nsearch_dir:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in all files in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: search_dir <search_term> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nsearch_file:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in file.

The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\n  signature: edit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit\n  arguments:\n    - start_line (integer) [required]: the line number to start the edit at\n    - end_line (integer) [required]: the line number to end the edit at (inclusive)\n    - replacement_text (string) [required]: the text to replace the current selection with\n\n\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\nIf you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

So these characters are not frequent use. But person name sometimes contains them. In the following example, the letter of \"鷗\" is only in ISO 2022 IR 159. But we cannot encode them correctly. \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport pydicom\r\n\r\njapanese_pn = u\"Mori^Ogai=森^鷗外=もり^おうがい\"\r\nspecific_character_sets = [\"ISO 2022 IR 6\", \"ISO 2022 IR 87\", \"ISO 2022 IR 159\"]\r\nexpect_encoded = (\r\n    b\"\\x4d\\x6f\\x72\\x69\\x5e\\x4f\\x67\\x61\\x69\\x3d\\x1b\\x24\\x42\\x3f\"\r\n    b\"\\x39\\x1b\\x28\\x42\\x5e\\x1b\\x24\\x28\\x44\\x6c\\x3f\\x1b\\x24\\x42\"\r\n    b\"\\x33\\x30\\x1b\\x28\\x42\\x3d\\x1b\\x24\\x42\\x24\\x62\\x24\\x6a\\x1b\"\r\n    b\"\\x28\\x42\\x5e\\x1b\\x24\\x42\\x24\\x2a\\x24\\x26\\x24\\x2c\\x24\\x24\"\r\n    b\"\\x1b\\x28\\x42\"\r\n)\r\n\r\npython_encodings = pydicom.charset.convert_encodings(specific_character_sets)\r\nactual_encoded = pydicom.charset.encode_string(japanese_pn, python_encodings)\r\n\r\nprint(\"actual:{}\".format(actual_encoded))\r\nprint(\"expect:{}\".format(expect_encoded))\r\n```\r\n#### Expected Results\r\n<!-- Please paste or describe the expected results.\r\nExample: No error is thrown and the name of the patient is printed.-->\r\n```\r\nb'Mori^Ogai=\\x1b$B?9\\x1b(B^\\x1b$(Dl?\\x1b$B30\\x1b(B=\\x1b$B$b$j\\x1b(B^\\x1b$B$*$&$,$$\\x1b(B'\r\n```\r\n#### Actual Results\r\n<!-- Please paste or specifically describe the actual output or traceback.\r\n(Use %xmode to deactivate ipython's trace beautifier)\r\nExample: ```AttributeError: 'FileDataset' object has no attribute 'PatientID'```\r\n-->\r\n```\r\nb'Mori^Ogai=?^??=??^????'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the followin exception occurs.\r\n\r\n```\r\n/PATH/TO/MY/PYTHON/PACKAGES/pydicom/charset.py:488: UserWarning: Failed to encode value with encodings: iso8859, iso2022_jp, iso-2022-jp - using replacement characters in encoded string\r\n  .format(', '.join(encodings)))\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\n<!--\r\nPlease run the following snippet and paste the output below.\r\nimport platform; print(platform.platform())\r\nimport sys; print(\"Python\", sys.version)\r\nimport pydicom; print(\"pydicom\", pydicom.__version__)\r\n-->\r\n```\r\nLinux-4.15.0-55-generic-x86_64-with-debian-buster-sid\r\nPython 3.6.9 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Jul 30 2019, 19:07:31)\r\n[GCC 7.3.0]\r\npydicom 1.3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /pydicom)\nbash-$"

Since the issue reported an encoding problem with `ISO 2022 IR 159`, we should look for the relevant sections that handle this specific encoding.\n\nOne of the sections that stands out is the `encode_string` function, which encodes a Unicode string into bytes using the provided encodings. We should examine this function to understand how it handles the `ISO 2022 IR 159` encoding and where the potential issue might be.\n\nAnother relevant section is the `convert_encodings` function, which converts DICOM encodings into corresponding Python encodings. We should ensure that `ISO 2022 IR 159` is correctly mapped to a Python encoding that can handle the necessary character set.\n\nGiven the complexity of the file, we may need to spend some time examining the logic and identifying the exact location where the encoding issue occurs. It could be within the `encode_string` function itself or possibly in one of the helper functions, such as `_encode_string_impl`.\n\nSince the file is long, let's start by examining the `encode_string` function to understand the overall flow and see where it might need adjustment.\n```\nsearch_file \"def encode_string\" pydicom/charset.py\n```"

For encodings that require an escape sequence, it adds the appropriate prefix and suffix.\n\nThe `ISO 2022 IR 159` encoding is mapped to `iso-2022-jp` in the `python_encoding` dictionary, and the corresponding escape sequence is `ESC + b'$(D'`. The code seems to handle this encoding correctly by adding the escape sequence when needed.\n\nHowever, the actual encoding and decoding are performed by the Python functions `encode` and `decode`. The `iso-2022-jp` encoding in Python should handle the necessary character set, but it seems that the issue may arise from the way the encoding is applied or from the specific characters in the string that are not being handled correctly by the `encode` function.\n\nBefore making any changes, we should test the `encode` function with the `iso-2022-jp` encoding directly to see if it can handle the character set correctly. This will help us narrow down the issue to either the `encode_string` function or the Python `encode` function.\n\nLet's create a test script to directly encode a string using `iso-2022-jp` and see the output.\n```\ncreate test_encode.py\n```"

This suggests that the Python `encode` function does not support this character under the `iso-2022-jp` encoding, which is the root cause of the issue.\n\nSince the `encode` function cannot handle the character, the `encode_string` function in the `charset.py` file will also fail to encode it. This means that the fix needs to be applied at the Python encoding level, rather than within the `pydicom` library's `encode_string` function.\n\nTo address this, we may need to look into custom encoding solutions or handle the encoding differently within the `encode_string` function to account for characters not supported by `iso-2022-jp`. One approach would be to use a different encoding, such as `UTF-8`, as a fallback for characters that are not encodable in `iso-2022-jp`.\n\nLet's modify the `encode_string` function to handle non-encodable characters by falling back to `UTF-8`. We will use the `replace` keyword to insert the correctly encoded UTF-8 bytes for unsupported characters.\n\nFirst, we need to locate the `_encode_string_impl` function, which actually performs the encoding, and modify it to handle the fallback encoding.\n```\nsearch_file \"def _encode_string_impl\" pydicom/charset.py\n```"
