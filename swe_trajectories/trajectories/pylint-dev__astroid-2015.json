Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly.

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "text": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nReplace modutils.is_standard_module() logic with sys.stdlib_module_names\n\r\nThis extends from the conversation in https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/pull/8190.\r\n\r\nThe logic in `modutils.is_standard_module()` should largely be able to be replaced with [sys.stdlib_module_names](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.stdlib_module_names), which was introduced in 3.10. The advantages are it will be faster (no imports, no filesystem traversal), it's not dependent on the local environment,  and it's maintained upstream, generated from source. For the referenced PR, I backported the generating code in CPython to generate sets for a shim to support 3.7 - 3.9.\r\n\r\nI started working on a PR for Astroid, but it seems `modutils.is_standard_module()` actually does two different things depending on how it's called.\r\n1. If no path is specified, it tries to determine if a module is part of the standard library (or a builtin, or compiled in) by inspecting the path of module after importing it.\r\n2. If a path is specified, it does the same logic, but ultimately is determining if the module is in the path specified.\r\n\r\nFor the second case, I could only find one case in the wild, in pyreverse.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/5bc4cd9a4b4c240227a41786823a6f226864dc4b/pylint/pyreverse/inspector.py#L308\r\n\r\nThese seem like different behaviors to me. I'm unsure how to proceed with PR. Here are some options I've considered.\r\n\r\n- Option 1:\r\n  - Introduce a new function, basically a wrapper for sys.stdlib_module_names and the shim\r\n  - Old behavior is preserved\r\n  - Advantage of a function, even though it's very simple, is it provides a space to add overriding logic if needed down the road\r\n   \r\n- Option 2:\r\n   - Only introduce the shim, so the code is in a common place for Astroid and Pylint\r\n   - Can be dropped with 3.9\r\n   - Old behavior is preserved\r\n\r\n- Option 3:\r\n  - Fall back to old behavior if a path is given, check sys.stdlib_module_names otherwise\r\n\r\n- Option 4:\r\n  - Deprecate `is_standard_module()`\r\n  - Introduce new functions more specific to how they are used\r\n\r\n- Option 5:\r\n  - Do Nothing\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are more options, but this is what comes to mind now. Would appreciate your thoughts and ideas.\r\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /astroid)\nbash-$"
