Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly.

Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "text": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nUsage of zipp.Path causes attempt to write after ZipFile is closed\nHello! I am attempting to use `zipp.Path` to construct a zip archive. I encountered the following issue:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport io\r\nfrom zipfile import ZipFile\r\nimport zipp\r\n\r\ndef make_zip():\r\n    \"\"\"Make zip file and return bytes.\"\"\"\r\n    bytes_io = io.BytesIO()\r\n    zip_file = ZipFile(bytes_io, mode=\"w\")\r\n    zipp_path = zipp.Path(zip_file)\r\n    \r\n    # use zipp.Path.open\r\n    with zipp_path.joinpath(\"file-a\").open(mode=\"wb\") as fp:\r\n        fp.write(b\"contents of file-a\")\r\n\r\n    zip_file.close()\r\n\r\n    data = bytes_io.getvalue()\r\n\r\n    bytes_io.close()\r\n    \r\n    return data\r\n\r\nzip_data = make_zip()\r\n# Exception ignored in: <bound method ZipFile.__del__ of <zipp.CompleteDirs [closed]>>\r\n# Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n#   File \"/Users/nw_henderson/.pyenv/versions/3.6.10/lib/python3.6/zipfile.py\", line 1686, in __del__\r\n#     self.close()\r\n#   File \"/Users/nw_henderson/.pyenv/versions/3.6.10/lib/python3.6/zipfile.py\", line 1703, in close\r\n#     self.fp.seek(self.start_dir)\r\n# ValueError: I/O operation on closed file.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFollowing the [zipfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.close) docs, I call `close()` before extracting the data from `bytes_io`. It looks like `zipp.Path` keeps some other reference to the file object and attempts to write when `make_zip` returns and objects are cleaned up.  Python 3.8 exhibits the same issue.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /zipp)\nbash-$"

The `self.root` is a `FastLookup` object, and the `self.at` is the path within the zip file. \n\nThe issue seems to be that the `Path` class keeps a reference to the file object after it is closed. To fix this, we need to ensure that the `Path` class does not keep a reference to the file object after it is closed. One way to do this is to modify the `open` method to not keep a reference to the file object after it is closed. \n\nLet's start by examining the `FastLookup` class and its `open` method to see how it handles the file object. We should look for the `FastLookup` class and its `open` method in the `zipp.py` file. First, let's search for the `FastLookup` class.\n```\nsearch_file \"class FastLookup\"\n```"

The `self.root` is a `FastLookup` object, and the `self.at` is the path within the zip file. \n\nThe issue seems to be that the `Path` class keeps a reference to the file object after it is closed. To fix this, we need to ensure that the `Path` class does not keep a reference to the file object after it is closed. One way to do this is to modify the `open` method to not keep a reference to the file object after it is closed. \n\nLet's start by examining the `FastLookup` class and its `open` method to see how it handles the file object. We should look for the `FastLookup` class and its `open` method in the `zipp.py` file. First, let's search for the `FastLookup` class.\n```\nsearch_file \"class FastLookup\"\n```"

The `self.root` is a `FastLookup` object, and the `self.at` is the path within the zip file. \n\nThe issue seems to be that the `Path` class keeps a reference to the file object after it is closed. To fix this, we need to ensure that the `Path` class does not keep a reference to the file object after it is closed. One way to do this is to modify the `open` method to not keep a reference to the file object after it is closed. \n\nLet's start by examining the `FastLookup` class and its `open` method to see how it handles the file object. We should look for the `FastLookup` class and its `open` method in the `zipp.py` file. First, let's search for the `FastLookup` class.\n```\nsearch_file \"class FastLookup\"\n```"
