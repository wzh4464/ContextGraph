The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly.

Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "text": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nbasic_auth_header uses the wrong flavor of base64\nI have reason to believe that `basic_auth_header` is wrong in using `urlsafe_b64encode` (which replaces `+/` with `-_`) instead of `b64encode`.\r\n\r\nThe first specification of HTTP basic auth according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) is [HTTP 1.0](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.0/spec.html#BasicAA), which does not mention any special flavor of base64, and points for a definition of base64 to RFC-1521, which [describes regular base64](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1521). The latest HTTP basic auth specification according to Wikipedia is [RFC-7617](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617), which similarly does not specify any special flavor of base64, and points to [section 4 of RFC-4648](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-4), which also describes the regular base64.\r\n\r\nI traced the origin of this bug, and it has been there [at least since the first Git commit of Scrapy](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blame/b45d87d0fe313458d03cd533dee2d3d03e057a04/scrapy/trunk/scrapy/http/request.py#L82).\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from w3lib.http import basic_auth_header\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> basic_auth_header('aa~aa¿', '')\r\nb'Basic YWF-YWG_Og=='\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> basic_auth_header('aa~aa¿', '')\r\nb'Basic YWF+YWG/Og=='\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe this bug only affects ASCII credentials that include the `>`, `?` or `~` characters in certain positions.\r\n\r\nFor richer encodings like UTF-8, which is what `basic_auth_header` uses (~~and makes sense as a default, but it should be configurable~~ [rightly so](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617#section-2.1)), many more characters can be affected (e.g. `¿` in the example above).\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /w3lib)\nbash-$"
