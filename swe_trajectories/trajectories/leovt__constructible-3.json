If line_number is provided, the window will be move to include that line\n  signature: open <path> [<line_number>]\n  arguments:\n    - path (string) [required]: the path to the file to open\n    - line_number (integer) [optional]: the line number to move the window to (if not provided, the window will start at the top of the file)\n\ngoto:\n  docstring: moves the window to show <line_number>\n  signature: goto <line_number>\n  arguments:\n    - line_number (integer) [required]: the line number to move the window to\n\nscroll_down:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_down\n\nscroll_up:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_up\n\ncreate:\n  docstring: creates and opens a new file with the given name\n  signature: create <filename>\n  arguments:\n    - filename (string) [required]: the name of the file to create\n\nsubmit:\n  docstring: submits your current code and terminates the session\n  signature: submit\n\nsearch_dir:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in all files in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: search_dir <search_term> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nsearch_file:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in file. If file is not provided, searches in the current open file\n  signature: search_file <search_term> [<file>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - file (string) [optional]: the file to search in (if not provided, searches in the current open file)\n\nfind_file:\n  docstring: finds all files with the given name in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: find_file <file_name> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - file_name (string) [required]: the name of the file to search for\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nedit:\n  docstring: replaces lines <start_line> through <end_line> (inclusive) with the given text in the open file. The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\n  signature: edit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit\n  arguments:\n    - start_line (integer) [required]: the line number to start the edit at\n    - end_line (integer) [required]: the line number to end the edit at (inclusive)\n    - replacement_text (string) [required]: the text to replace the current selection with\n\n\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\nIf you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "text": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nsqrt(2) * sqrt(3) returns None\n```py\r\n>>> print(sqrt(2) * sqrt(3))\r\nNone\r\n>>> print(sqrt(2) / sqrt(3))\r\nNone\r\n```\r\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /constructible)\nbash-$"

The method returns `None` if there is no square root in the field, which might be the cause of the `None` result we saw in the issue.\n\nThe issue might be due to the way the `_try_sqrt` method handles the calculation or the conditions under which it returns `None`. To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the method returns the correct result instead of `None` for the given inputs.\n\nBefore making any changes, it's important to understand the logic of the `_try_sqrt` method and how it interacts with the `sqrt` function. The `sqrt` function calls `n._try_sqrt()` and if it is `None`, it returns `Constructible(Constructible.lift_rational_field(0, n.field), Constructible.lift_rational_field(1, n.field), (n, n.field))`, which might be the source of the issue.\n\nLet's proceed by examining the logic of the `_try_sqrt` method and the `sqrt` function to determine where the problem might be. We will use the example inputs from the issue, `sqrt(2)` and `sqrt(3)`, to test the logic.\n\nFirst, let's test the `_try_sqrt` method with the input `Constructible(2)` to see if it returns `None` or the correct result.\n\n```\nprint(Constructible(2)._try_sqrt())\n```"

      "text": "We have found the `__mul__` and `__truediv__` methods of the `Constructible` class. The `__mul__` method handles multiplication and seems to correctly handle the case where both operands are `Constructible` objects. The `__truediv__` method handles division and also seems to correctly handle the case where the other operand is a `Constructible` object by using the `inverse` method.\n\nThe issue might be related to how the `sqrt` function is invoked within the context of multiplication or division. It's possible that the `sqrt` function is not being applied correctly during the operation.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to ensure that the `sqrt` function is correctly applied during multiplication and division operations involving `Constructible` objects. This might involve modifying the `__mul__` or `__truediv__` methods to handle the `sqrt` function properly.\n\nBefore making any changes, it's important to understand how the `sqrt` function should be applied within these operations. We should consider whether the issue is with the `sqrt` function itself or with how it is being used in the context of these operations.\n\nGiven the complexity of the issue, it would be prudent to consult with a mathematics expert or a senior developer who has experience with computational algebra systems. They would be able to provide guidance on how the `sqrt` function should be handled within the `Constructible` class operations.\n\nSince we cannot directly consult with an expert or senior developer in this environment, we should proceed with caution. We should consider whether the issue is with the `sqrt` function itself or with how it is being used in the context of multiplication or division.\n\nIf we assume that the issue is with the `sqrt` function itself, we could try to modify the function to ensure it returns the correct result for `Constructible` objects. However, if the issue is with how the `sqrt` function is being used in the context of multiplication or division, then we need to modify the `__mul__` or `__truediv__` methods to ensure correct usage.\n\nLet's proceed by examining the `sqrt` function again to understand how it handles `Constructible` objects and make any necessary changes to ensure it returns the correct result.\n\nWe should scroll down to find the `sqrt` function, which is located near the end of the file.\n\n```\nscroll_down\n```"

We will use a while loop to find the closest approximate representation of the square root, similar to what we did with the `sqrt` function.\n\n```\nedit 316:352\n    def _try_sqrt(self):\n        ''' try to compute the square root in the field itself.\n        \n        if there is no square root in the field return None.\n        '''\n        if not self.field:\n            assert self.b == 0\n            root, remainder = fsqrt(self.a)\n            if remainder == 1:\n                return Constructible(root)\n            else:\n                return None\n\n        if self._sign() < 0:\n            raise ValueError('math domain error %s' % self)\n\n        nn = self.a * self.a - self.b * self.b * self.r\n        if nn._sign() < 0:\n            return None\n\n        n = nn._try_sqrt()\n        if n is None:\n            return None\n\n        a = ((self.a + n) * Fraction(1, 2))._try_sqrt()\n        if a is not None:\n            result = Constructible(a, self.b / a * Fraction(1, 2), self.field)\n            assert result.field == self.field\n            return result\n\n        b = ((self.a + n) / self.r * Fraction(1, 2))._try_sqrt()\n        if b is not None:\n            result = Constructible(self.b / b * Fraction(1, 2), b, self.field)\n            assert result.field == self.field\n            return result\n\n        # Find the closest approximate representation of the square root\n        a = 0\n        b = self\n        while b - a > 1e-10:\n            c = (a + b) / 2\n            if c * c > self:\n                a = c\n            else:\n                b = c\n        return Constructible(b)\nend_of_edit\n```"

The method should return an approximate representation of the square root if it is not a perfect square.\n\nTo fix this, we need to modify the `_try_sqrt` method to handle the case where the square root is not a perfect square and return an approximate representation.\n\nLet's proceed by editing the `_try_sqrt` method to handle this case.

This indicates that the `_try_sqrt` method is not correctly calculating the approximate representation of the square root.\n\nThe issue might be that the `_try_sqrt` method does not correctly handle the case where the square root is not a perfect square, which is common for most numbers. The method should return an approximate representation of the square root if it is not a perfect square.\n\nTo fix this, we need to modify the `_try_sqrt` method to handle the case where the square root is not a perfect square and return an approximate representation.\n\nLet's proceed by examining the `_try_sqrt` method again to understand why it still returns `None`.\n\nWe should scroll up to find the `_try_sqrt` method, which is located near the beginning of the file.\n\n```\nscroll_up\n```"
