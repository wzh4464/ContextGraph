      "text": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nClass invariant changes __dict__ unexpectedly\nUsually `__dict__` can be used to compare if two instances have equal attributes. Adding an class invariant falsifies a `__eq__` method which is based on this assumption:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nfrom icontract import invariant  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n@invariant(lambda self: all(\" \" not in n for n in self.parts))  \r\nclass ID:  \r\n    def __init__(self, identifier: str) -> None:  \r\n        self.parts = identifier.split(\".\")  \r\n  \r\n    def __eq__(self, other: object) -> bool:  \r\n        if isinstance(other, self.__class__):  \r\n            print(self.__dict__)  \r\n            print(other.__dict__)  \r\n            return self.__dict__ == other.__dict__  \r\n        return NotImplemented   \r\n  \r\n  \r\nprint(ID(\"A\") == ID(\"A\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```Console\r\n{'parts': ['A'], '__dbc_invariant_check_is_in_progress__': True}\r\n{'parts': ['A']}\r\nFalse\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the shown example it is of course quite simple to fix the issue. In my use case multiple classes are inherited from a base class containing such a `__eq__` method. Each inherited class contains different additional attributes. Adding a separate `__eq__` method for each class containing an invariant would be cumbersome.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /icontract)\nbash-$"

This suggests that the `remove_in_progress_dunder` function is not being called as expected. We should verify that the function is being registered correctly as a callback to the `ExitStack` and that the stack is being popped correctly to trigger the callback. It's also possible that the attribute is being added or removed elsewhere in the code, which is why we didn't see the desired effect after the first edit. \n\nGiven these uncertainties, we should take a more direct approach to ensure the removal of the `__dbc_invariant_check_is_in_progress__` attribute from the `__dict__`.

The `hasattr` check we added before calling `remove_in_progress_dunder` is likely returning `True` incorrectly or the attribute is being removed elsewhere in the code. Given these uncertainties, we should re-evaluate our approach to ensure the proper addition and removal of the `__dbc_invariant_check_is_in_progress__` attribute.\n\nInstead of relying on the `hasattr` check, we should use a more robust approach to handle the `__dbc_invariant_check_is_in_progress__` attribute. We will ensure that the attribute is added and removed symmetrically within the `wrapper` function. To do this, we'll add a finally block to the `wrapper` function to explicitly remove the `__dbc_invariant_check_is_in_progress__` attribute, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. This will guarantee that the attribute is removed after the invariant check is complete. Let's proceed with the edit to the code to include a `finally` block.\n\n```\nedit 472:476\n                try:\n                    for contract in instance.__class__.__invariants__:\n                        _assert_invariant(contract=contract, instance=instance)\n                except Exception:\n                    raise\n                finally:\n                    remove_in_progress_dunder()  # ensure the dunder is removed explicitly\nend_of_edit\n```"

The `wrapper` variable should be assigned within the `if is_init` block, but it seems that the control flow is not entering that block, or the assignment is not happening correctly. We need to ensure that the `wrapper` variable is assigned properly before the `update_wrapper` call. \n\nLet's review the `_decorate_with_invariants` function to understand the control flow and ensure that the `wrapper` variable is assigned correctly. We will focus on the initialization of the `wrapper` variable and its use in the `update_wrapper` call. Given that the error message indicates that `wrapper` is referenced before assignment, we need to add the assignment of `wrapper` earlier in the code, within the first `if` block where `is_init` is checked.
