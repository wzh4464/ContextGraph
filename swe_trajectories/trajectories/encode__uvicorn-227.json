Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed.

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nError integrating with Channels if 'lifespan' is not specified in router\nI'm not entirely sure if I should be posting this here or on `channels`.\r\n\r\nI'm using v0.3.12 which I believe has already introduced the new `lifespan` protocol defined in asgiref. But this causes an error with `channels`' router\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n   File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/uvicorn/lifespan.py\", line 29, in run\r\n     await self.asgi(self.receive, self.send)\r\n   File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/uvicorn/middleware/message_logger.py\", line 51, in __call__\r\n     inner = self.app(self.scope)\r\n   File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/channels/routing.py\", line 58, in __call__\r\n     raise ValueError(\"No application configured for scope type %r\" % scope[\"type\"])\r\nValueError: No application configured for scope type 'lifespan'\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy `routing.py` file looks like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\napplication = ProtocolTypeRouter({\r\n    # Empty for now (http->django views is added by default)\r\n    'websocket': JWTWebsocketMiddleware(\r\n        URLRouter(urlpatterns)\r\n    )\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: Sorry my workaround wasn't actually working as you'll need at least one `path` in the `URLRouter`, so I've removed it.\r\n\r\nTo temporarily get around this, I had to downgrade to `v0.3.9`.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /uvicorn)\nbash-$"

The error described in the issue seems to be related to the `lifespan.startup` event not being handled correctly, as the `Lifespan` instance expects an `lifespan.startup.complete` message but doesn't seem to be sending it.\n\nTo address this, we may need to ensure that the `Lifespan` instance sends the appropriate messages to the application during the `lifespan` protocol execution. However, since we don't have the complete stack trace or a reproduction script, it's difficult to say exactly where the issue is occurring.\n\nGiven that the error message indicates that the issue is related to the `channels` router not recognizing the `lifespan` scope type, the problem might be that the `channels` application is not configured to handle the `lifespan` protocol correctly. In a normal development environment, the next step would be to check the `channels` application configuration and ensure that it is correctly set up to handle the `lifespan` protocol. However, since we cannot run the application here, we'll have to proceed with this assumption.\n\nLet's inspect the `run` method in the `Lifespan` class to see if there is an obvious issue with how it handles the `lifespan` protocol. Perhaps we need to add a send message for `lifespan.startup.complete` to the `run` method to correctly complete the startup phase of the `lifespan` protocol.\n\n```\nedit 29:29\n            await self.asgi(self.receive, self.send)\n            await self.send({'type': 'lifespan.startup.complete'})\nend_of_edit\n```"
