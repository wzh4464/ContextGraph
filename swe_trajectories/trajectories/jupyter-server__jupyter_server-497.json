Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "text": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nSymlinks with inaccessible targets cause filemanager to not list anything in the same directory\n## Description\r\n\r\nIt seems that in jupyter_core, in `is_file_hidden_posix()` an exception is raised if it comes across a symlink where the target path is not accessible to the user (PermissionError). This has the effect of stopping the file contents manager in JupyterLab 3 from displaying the contents of a directory containing such links.\r\n\r\nThe traceback looks like the following, where the symlink points to a directory that is not accessible to user1:\r\n\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/tornado/web.py\", line 1704, in _execute\r\n        result = await result\r\n      File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/jupyter_server/services/contents/handlers.py\", line 110, in get\r\n        model = await ensure_async(self.contents_manager.get(\r\n      File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/jupyter_server/services/contents/filemanager.py\", line 381, in get\r\n        model = self._dir_model(path, content=content)\r\n      File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/jupyter_server/services/contents/filemanager.py\", line 288, in _dir_model\r\n        if self.allow_hidden or not is_file_hidden(os_path, stat_res=st):\r\n      File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/jupyter_core/paths.py\", line 297, in is_file_hidden_posix\r\n        stat_res = os.stat(abs_path)\r\n    PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/user1/subdir/secret'\r\n\r\n## Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Have user 1 create a directory that user 2 cannot see, and have user 2 link to the directory created by user 1\r\n2. Have user 2 do something like `touch a b c` in the same directory as their symlink\r\n2. Have user 2 start up JupyterLab 3 with jupyter_server\r\n3. Browsing to the directory containing the symlink cause the file listing to freeze\r\n4. Logs will show traceback similar to above \r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe file listing should just omit the disallowed link since but list everything else that can normally be listed.\r\nI think this means that jupyter_server should handle the exception.  See also jupyter/jupyter_core#224\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n- Operating System and version: ubuntu:focal\r\n- Browser and version: Chrome 90.0.4430.93\r\n- Jupyter Server version: 1.6.4\r\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /jupyter_server)\nbash-$"

The code at this location is handling the listing of files in a directory, and it skips over broken symlinks in the process. The handling of symlinks seems to be related to the issue described, as the problem occurs when the contents manager encounters a symlink whose target path is not accessible to the user.\n\nThe current implementation logs a warning and continues the listing process without following the symlink if it encounters a broken symlink. However, the issue description suggests that the entire directory listing stops when an inaccessible symlink is encountered. \n\nIt's possible that the solution will involve catching the PermissionError exception and continuing the listing process without following the symlink, similar to how broken symlinks are handled. Let's edit the code to catch the PermissionError exception and continue the listing process. We should modify the exception handling part of this code block to include the PermissionError exception.\n\nFirst, let's identify the block of code that needs to be modified. It's likely that the modification is needed in the same try-except block where the ENOENT error is handled.\n\nWe will edit the except block to include the PermissionError exception and skip the symlink if the target is not accessible.\n```\nedit 274:277\n                    if e.errno in (errno.ENOENT, errno.EACCES):\n                        self.log.warning(\"%s doesn't exist or is not accessible\", os_path)\n                    else:\n                        self.log.warning(\"Error stat-ing %s: %s\", os_path, e)\nend_of_edit\n```"
