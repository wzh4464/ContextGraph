      "text": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nsonify.time_frequency regression\n@leighsmith looks like modernizing the tests #370 surfaced a bug in the optimization of time_frequency sonification #355 \r\n\r\nThe bug only seems to show up in the chord sonification, which goes through chord→chroma and chroma→time_frequency.  It works fine when `length=None` is used, but when `length` is explicitly passed and different from the end of the last time interval, we end up with a length mismatch at\r\nhttps://github.com/craffel/mir_eval/blob/57f7c31b120f6135c31207295372e3b67848126d/mir_eval/sonify.py#L190-L191 .\r\n\r\nWe didn't have this problem before #355 because the length was always precisely determined to using matching `start:end` indices for each time interval.\r\n\r\nSince I'm in the midst of revamping all the tests, we're not really in a good place to handle this bugfix as a separate PR yet.  If there's an easy fix, I'd like to roll it into #370 so we can merge things in a passing state.  Otherwise I might mark that test as a known fail for now and we can come back to it after merging 370.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /mir_eval)\nbash-$"

The issue suggests that there is a length mismatch when the `length` parameter is explicitly passed and is different from the end of the last time interval. This problem is likely due to the way the `gram_interpolator` is being created and used.\n\nTo address this, we need to ensure that the `gram_interpolator` handles the case where the `length` parameter is provided and is different from the default length based on the time centers. We will need to modify the code to correctly handle this situation.\n\nBefore we make any changes, let's consider the specific requirements:\n\n1. When `length` is provided, it should be used to determine the range of the interpolation, rather than the default length based on the time centers.\n2. The `gram_interpolator` should be created with the correct bounds to match the specified `length`.\n3. The output waveform should be scaled correctly to match the specified `length`.\n\nWe will need to update the code to meet these requirements. Let's proceed with making the necessary changes, starting with the creation of the `gram_interpolator`.\n\nFirst, we need to update the `gram_interpolator` to use the correct bounds when the `length` parameter is provided.
