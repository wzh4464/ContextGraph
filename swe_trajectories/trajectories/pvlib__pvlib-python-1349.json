Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\n`spectrum.spectrl2` calculates negative irradiance for angle of incidence outside +/- 90°\nWhen using pvlib (but also the spectrl2 implementation provided by NREL), I obtain negative Irradiance for a north-facing panel.\r\nFrom @kevinsa5 's [reply on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70172766/pvlib-bird1984-north-facing-element-shows-negative-irradiance/70174010#70174010) I take that this is in fact not intended.\r\n\r\nIn the example code below, the angle of incidence is calculated as values around 115°, so exceeding a possible (implicitly assumed) +/- 90° bound (sun behind panel).\r\n\r\nThis seems to be left open in the original report ([Bird & Riordan, 1984](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/old/2436.pdf)).\r\n\r\nThe direct irradiance `I_d` (*of a horizontal panel*, Eq 2-1) is obtained by multiplying by cosine of the sun zenith angle. I'd guess that setting that value strictly to zero for angles when cosZ is negative would not be too much of a stretch.\r\n\r\nThen, the direct irradiance `I_d` goes into (Eq 3-18):\r\n\r\n```\r\nI_T(t) = I_d*cos(aoi) + I_s * ( (I_d*cos(aoi) / (H_0*D*cos(Z)) ) + 0.5*(1+cos(t)) * (1 - I_d/(H_0*D)) + 0.5 * I_T0 * r_g * (1-cos(t))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs such, when you view the angle of incidence `aoi` as the analogue of the sun zenith angle in the prior example, the two first terms of the diffuse irradiation (Eq 3-18) would become zero, which - again - for the direct irradiance would kind of make sense. What remains of (Eq 3-18) would be\r\n\r\n```\r\nI_T(t) = 0 + 0 + 0.5*(1+cos(t))*(1 - 0) + 0.5*I_T0*r_g*(1-cos(t))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not from the field, so I'm very, very wary about the implications of such a work-around suggestion. Can anyone with a proper background comment on this? (Maybe it's the future of air conditioning :-D)\r\n\r\n\r\n**MWE based on the tutorial below**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n## Using PV Lib\r\n\r\nfrom pvlib import spectrum, solarposition, irradiance, atmosphere\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\r\n# assumptions from the technical report:\r\nlat = 49.88\r\nlon = 8.63\r\ntilt = 45\r\nazimuth = 0 # North = 0\r\npressure = 101300  # sea level, roughly\r\nwater_vapor_content = 0.5  # cm\r\ntau500 = 0.1\r\nozone = 0.31  # atm-cm\r\nalbedo = 0.2\r\n\r\ntimes = pd.date_range('2021-11-30 8:00', freq='h', periods=6, tz=\"Europe/Berlin\") # , tz='Etc/GMT+9'\r\nsolpos = solarposition.get_solarposition(times, lat, lon)\r\naoi = irradiance.aoi(tilt, azimuth, solpos.apparent_zenith, solpos.azimuth)\r\n\r\n# The technical report uses the 'kasten1966' airmass model, but later\r\n# versions of SPECTRL2 use 'kastenyoung1989'.

Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /pvlib-python)\nbash-$"
