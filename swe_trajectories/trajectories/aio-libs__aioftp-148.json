Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "text": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nDirectory traversal / base path escape possible on Windows\nThe server allows escaping the user `base_path` on Windows using absolute path (segments).\r\nThis is due to [`get_paths`](https://github.com/aio-libs/aioftp/blob/81d4bc018261268bf2ea88f42e05f130ab4c9229/aioftp/server.py#L991):\r\nWhile the virtual path handling is perfectly fine in itself (it represents a POSIX path, so all is good there), the joining between `base_path` and `resolved_virtual_path` is not and quickly falls apart when Windows absolute paths are involved.\r\nIn my opinion this presets a serious security issue when developers naively rely on the `base_path` setting to not allow users to traverse outside of it.\r\n\r\nConsider the following:\r\n```python\r\nbase_path = pathlib.Path(\"C:\\\\locked_path\")  # base_path is of the type Path (so platform dependent path)\r\n```\r\nNow see what happens when the input virtual path contains Windows absolute path segments:\r\n```python\r\nresolved_virtual_path = pathlib.PurePosixPath(\"/foo/C:\\\\Windows/bla\")\r\nreal_path = base_path / resolved_virtual_path.relative_to(\"/\")\r\n>>> PureWindowsPath('C:/Windows/bla')\r\n```\r\nYou have now broken out.\r\nThis is due to two reasons:\r\n1. While joining, `pathlib` joins each path segment to the list of first path object with the following rule:\r\n    > When several absolute paths are given, the last is taken as an anchor (mimicking os.path.join()’s behaviour)\r\n    This is also the reason the `relative_to(\"/\")` does not help here.\r\n2. When joining, `pathlib` joins according to the rules of the first path object, so in this case it pulls out all path `parts` from the `PurePosixPath` and joins them to the `PureWindowsPath` by the rules of `PureWindowsPath`, meaning the Windows absolute anchor in the `PurePosixPath` is interpreted as on Windows.\r\n\r\nThere are a myriad of ways to _almost_ fix it inside the virtual path, but they always have special cases that break them and I do not consider them safe.\r\nIn my opinion, the best way to prevent any directory traversal using `pathlib` is by going by the resulting absolute path.\r\n1. Join the `resolved_virtual_path` to the `base_path` as is already done, but using the anchor given in the path to be relative to since users can pass Windows anchors too:\r\n   ```\r\n   real_path = base_path / resolved_virtual_path.relative_to(resolved_virtual_path.anchor)\r\n   ```\r\n2. Use `relative_to` to make sure the joined `real_path` is still relative to / inside the `base_path` and give us the fully resolved (all absolute anchors removed) subdirectory/virtual path at the same time:\r\n   ```\r\n   resolved_virtual_path = pathlib.PurePosixPath(\"/\") / real_path.relative_to(base_path)\r\n   ```\r\n3. If the previous call raises (with our example from above: `ValueError: 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\bla' is not in the subpath of 'C:\\\\locked_path' OR one path is relative and the other is absolute.`) we know that a traversal was attempted and can either return \r\n    1. An access denied error (not very fitting in the current design, would need to either convert to using exceptions or add lots of boilerplate)\r\n    2. Just return something like `base_path, pathlib.PurePosixPath(\"/\")` to throw the user back to the home directory.\r\n\r\nI will submit a pull request shortly.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /aioftp)\nbash-$"
