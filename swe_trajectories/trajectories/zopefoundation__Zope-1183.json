Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nClarification on  Handling Image Uploads via HTTP PUT in Zope5 with WSGI Server\n### What I did:\r\n\r\nI encountered an issue related to the handling of image uploads when using the HTTP PUT method in Zope5 with a WSGI server. Here are the steps I followed to reproduce the problem:\r\n\r\n1. Using a Zope5 installation with the WSGI server.\r\n2. Sending an HTTP PUT request to upload an image.\r\n3. Observing that the image data is received in the request body as encoded data.\r\n\r\n### What I expect to happen:\r\n\r\nI expected that, similar to Zope4 with the ZServer, I would receive the image data as part of the form, and I would be able to access it as an object. This is the behavior I was accustomed to in Zope4.\r\n\r\n### What actually happened:\r\n\r\nIn Zope5 with the WSGI server, when I use the HTTP PUT method to upload an image, the image data is received in the request body, and the body data is encoded. As a result, I am unable to access the image data as a file upload object, which is different from the behavior in Zope4.\r\n\r\n### What version of Python and Zope/Addons I am using:\r\n\r\n- Operating System: Windows/Linux\r\n- Python Version: 3.10.9\r\n- Zope Version: 5.8.3\r\n\r\nThis report aims to highlight the difference in behavior between Zope4 and Zope5 when using HTTP PUT for image uploads and to understand whether this is the expected behavior for PUT operations.\r\n\r\nAdditional Observation:\r\nhttps://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/blob/5.8.3/src/ZPublisher/HTTPRequest.py#L1425\r\nIf i include \"PUT\" condition here, it is working as expected\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /Zope)\nbash-$"

The code here suggests that it is primarily focused on POST requests and does not explicitly mention PUT.\n\nSince PUT is not mentioned, it is possible that the existing handling in the code is not sufficient for PUT requests, or it is not being recognized as a valid method for uploading files.\n\nGiven this context, we may need to add or modify code to ensure that PUT requests are handled similarly to POST, particularly when it comes to file uploads. Let's make the necessary changes to accommodate PUT requests.\n\nWe'll start by adding a check for the PUT method alongside the existing POST handling. This should allow the parser to process form data and file uploads from PUT requests as well.\n\nLet's edit the code to include the PUT method in the conditional that handles form data parsing.\n\n```\nedit 1445:1447\n        parts = ()\n        if method in (\"POST\", \"PUT\") \\\n           and content_type in \\\n           (\"multipart/form-data\", \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"):\nend_of_edit\n```"
