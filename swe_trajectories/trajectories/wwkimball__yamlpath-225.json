Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "text": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nDifficulty using MergerConfig\nHey, first off, thanks for the awesome library. This project solves a huge recurring problem for me when trying to parse config files. I plan to use this in a lot of projects moving forward.\r\n\r\nFrom my experience, it seems like this project is CLI-first rather than API-first. This makes the library a huge pain to integrate into other projects. For example, I'm trying to make a CLI program that merges some YAML files, overwriting only specific nodes. It seems like the only way to specify these exceptions using this project is to write out a config file with a list of rules (which in my case changes on every run). This adds unnecessary complexity as I should be able to just pass these options to the `MergerConfig` class directly.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the YAML path rules I'm writing into the config include the `:` character, which `ConfigParse` likes to convert to `=`. Then the code in `MergerConfig` assumes that the `=` symbol is part of the value, not the key. I've solve this problem by using the following nasty hack:\r\n```python\r\n        old_init = configparser.ConfigParser.__init__\r\n\r\n        def new_init(self):\r\n            old_init(self, delimiters=\"=\")\r\n\r\n        configparser.ConfigParser.__init__ = new_init\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth of these problems can be solved by allowing rules, defaults, and key to be specified in the class constructor, and only loading from a config file in the event these values are absent.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /yamlpath)\nbash-$"

Now we need to ensure that these parameters are properly used to initialize the corresponding attributes and that any existing configuration loading or rule application methods are adjusted accordingly.\n\nFrom the updated code, it appears that the attributes `self.rules` and `self.keys` are being reset to empty dictionaries after the `_load_config` method is called. This is likely because the `_load_config` method was designed to load configuration from a file and overwrite any existing attributes. We need to modify the `_load_config` method to preserve the rules and keys provided in the constructor.\n\nLet's scroll down to locate the `_load_config` method and see how it is currently implemented.\n\n```\nscroll_down\n```"
