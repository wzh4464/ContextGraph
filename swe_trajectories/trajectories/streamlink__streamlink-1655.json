If line_number is provided, the window will be move to include that line\n  signature: open <path> [<line_number>]\n  arguments:\n    - path (string) [required]: the path to the file to open\n    - line_number (integer) [optional]: the line number to move the window to (if not provided, the window will start at the top of the file)\n\ngoto:\n  docstring: moves the window to show <line_number>\n  signature: goto <line_number>\n  arguments:\n    - line_number (integer) [required]: the line number to move the window to\n\nscroll_down:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_down\n\nscroll_up:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_up\n\ncreate:\n  docstring: creates and opens a new file with the given name\n  signature: create <filename>\n  arguments:\n    - filename (string) [required]: the name of the file to create\n\nsubmit:\n  docstring: submits your current code and terminates the session\n  signature: submit\n\nsearch_dir:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in all files in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: search_dir <search_term> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nsearch_file:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in file. If file is not provided, searches in the current open file\n  signature: search_file <search_term> [<file>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - file (string) [optional]: the file to search in (if not provided, searches in the current open file)\n\nfind_file:\n  docstring: finds all files with the given name in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: find_file <file_name> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - file_name (string) [required]: the name of the file to search for\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nedit:\n  docstring: replaces lines <start_line> through <end_line> (inclusive) with the given text in the open file. The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\n  signature: edit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit\n  arguments:\n    - start_line (integer) [required]: the line number to start the edit at\n    - end_line (integer) [required]: the line number to end the edit at (inclusive)\n    - replacement_text (string) [required]: the text to replace the current selection with\n\n\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\nIf you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nNeed a option for DNS through proxy\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] This is a bug report.\r\n- [x] This is a feature request.\r\n- [ ] This is a plugin (improvement) request.\r\n- [ ] I have read the contribution guidelines.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nSteamlink can't resolve hostnames through the proxy server. If you receive a incorrect ip of the host via DNS spoofing, the option --http-proxy and --https-proxy may not work correctly.\r\n\r\n### Expected / Actual behavior\r\nExpected: Steamkink connect to youtube server through proxy and work fine.\r\nActual: Read timed out.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction steps / Explicit stream URLs to test\r\n1. Run a socks5 proxy server on port 1080\r\n2. streamlink --hls-live-restart --http-proxy \"socks5://127.0.0.1:1080\" --https-proxy \"socks5://127.0.0.1:1080\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fO8x9MZ8m9g\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n[cli][debug] OS:         Windows 10\r\n[cli][debug] Python:     3.6.5\r\n[cli][debug] Streamlink: 0.12.1\r\n[cli][debug] Requests(2.18.4), Socks(1.6.7), Websocket(0.47.0)\r\n[cli][info] Found matching plugin youtube for URL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fO8x9MZ8m9g\r\nerror: Unable to open URL: https://youtube.com/get_video_info (SOCKSHTTPSConnectionPool(host='youtube.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Firefox works fine because it send the DNS request through the proxy.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /streamlink)\nbash-$"

The `requests.Session` class allows you to set proxy settings for HTTP and HTTPS requests.\n\nTo handle DNS resolution through the proxy, we need to ensure that the DNS requests are also sent through the proxy. This can be achieved by using a SOCKS proxy for all traffic, including DNS requests.\n\nLet's check how the `HTTPSession` class handles proxy settings and see if we can configure it to use a SOCKS proxy for all traffic.\n\n### Configuring Proxy Settings\n\nThe `requests` library allows you to set proxy settings for HTTP and HTTPS requests by using the `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` parameters when making a request. To use a SOCKS proxy, you need to install a library like `requests[socks]` or `PySocks` and then set the `socks_proxy` parameter to the address of your SOCKS proxy.\n\nHere's an example of how to set a SOCKS proxy in requests:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Set the SOCKS proxy address.\nsocks_proxy = \"socks5://127.0.0.1:1080\"\n\n# Create a session object.\nsession = requests.Session()\n\n# Set the proxies dictionary with the SOCKS proxy.\nsession.proxies = {\n    \"http\": socks_proxy,\n    \"https\": socks_proxy\n}\n\n# Now all requests made with this session will use the SOCKS proxy.\nresponse = session.get(\"https://example.com\")\nprint(response.text)\n```\n\nIn the context of streamlink, you would need to set the `proxies` attribute of the `HTTPSession` object to use the SOCKS proxy. This will ensure that all HTTP and HTTPS requests, including DNS resolution, are routed through the proxy.\n\n### Applying the Solution\n\nLet's apply this solution to the `HTTPSession` class in the `http_session.py` file. We need to set the `proxies` attribute of the `HTTPSession` object to use the SOCKS proxy. We'll assume that the proxy settings are provided as options when initializing the `Streamlink` object.\n\nFirst, let's make an edit to the `__init__` method of the `HTTPSession` class to accept a `proxies` parameter and set the `self.proxies` attribute.\n\n```\nedit 63:65\nclass HTTPSession(Session):\n    def __init__(self, proxies=None, *args, **kwargs):\n        Session.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)\n        self.proxies = proxies\nend_of_edit\n```"

The error in the test script is likely due to the `proxy` parameter not being passed correctly to the `HTTPSession` constructor, or the `HTTPSession` object not being used correctly to make the HTTP request.\n\nSince the `http` attribute is set to the `HTTPSession` object in the `Streamlink` class, we should check how the `http` attribute is being used in the `streams` method and other parts of the code to ensure that it is being used correctly to make the HTTP requests.\n\n### Update\n\nUpon further review, it seems that the issue might be related to how the `proxy` parameter is being passed to the `HTTPSession` constructor. The `proxy` parameter should be a dictionary with the keys `http` and `https` set to the proxy URL. Alternatively, the `proxies` parameter should be used directly with the `HTTPSession` constructor.\n\nLet's update the `__init__` method of the `Streamlink` class to ensure that the `proxies` parameter is passed correctly to the `HTTPSession` constructor.\n\n```\nedit 41:42\n    def __init__(self, proxies=None):\n        self.http = api.HTTPSession(proxies=proxies)\nend_of_edit\n```"
