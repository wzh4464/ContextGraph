Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed.

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nInfinite recursion on _STIXBase object deserialization\nHi!\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a bug in the way the `__getitem__`/`__getattr__` functions are implemented in `_STIXBase` (_cti-python-stix2/stix2/base.py_). The bug can be reproduced by trying to serialize/deserialize an object instance, resulting in infinite recursion causing the program to terminate with a `RecursionError` once the max recursion depth is exceeded. \r\n\r\nHere is a short example with copy.copy() triggering the recursion:\r\n```\r\nimport copy, stix2\r\nindicator = stix2.Indicator(name=\"a\", labels=[\"a\"], pattern=\"[file:name = 'a']\")\r\ncopy.copy(indicator)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe this is because the unpickling tries to find the optional `__set_state__` method in `_STIXBase`. But since it's not there, the `__getattr__` is being called for it. However, the way `__getattr__` is implemented in the class, the `__getitem__` is called which  tries to look up an item in `self._inner`. Due to the way the deserialization works in general, the object itself is empty and the `__init__` was never called - meaning that the `_inner` attribute was never set. The access attempt on the non-existent `_inner` however triggers a call to `__getattr__` again, resulting in the recursion.\r\n\r\nHere are two possible patches, I'm not sure though if that's the proper way of fixing it:\r\n\r\n1) Checking for `_inner` access in `__getitem__`:\r\n```\r\ndef __getitem__(self, key):\r\n    if key == '_inner':\r\n        raise KeyError\r\n    return self._inner[key]\r\n\r\n```\r\n2) Checking for protected attributes in `__getattr__`:\r\n```\r\ndef __getattr__(self, name):\r\n    if name.startswith('_'):\r\n        raise AttributeError(name)\r\n    if name in self:\r\n        return self.__getitem__(name)\r\n    raise AttributeError(\"'%s' object has no attribute '%s'\" %\r\n                         (self.__class__.__name__, name))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks!\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /cti-python-stix2)\nbash-$"

      "text": "We are now looking at the `__getattr__` method of the `_STIXBase` class. The issue suggests that there is a recursion problem in this method. Let's take a closer look. The `__getattr__` method is called when an attribute is accessed. In this case, it checks if the attribute is in the object's `_inner` dictionary. If it is, it calls the `__getitem__` method to return the value. However, if the attribute is not in the `_inner` dictionary, it raises an `AttributeError`.\n\nThe problem is that when the `__getattr__` method is called, it tries to access the attribute again, which calls the `__getattr__` method again, and so on. This creates an infinite recursion loop.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify the `__getattr__` method to avoid this recursion loop. One way to do this is to check if the attribute is a protected attribute (i.e., it starts with an underscore) before trying to access it. If it is a protected attribute, we can raise an `AttributeError` immediately.\n\nLet's modify the `__getattr__` method to add this check.\n```\nedit 187:193\n    def __getattr__(self, name):\n        if name.startswith('_'):\n            raise AttributeError(\"'%s' object has no attribute '%s'\" % (self.__class__.__name__, name))\n        if name in self:\n            return self.__getitem__(name)\n        raise AttributeError(\"'%s' object has no attribute '%s'\" % (self.__class__.__name__, name))\nend_of_edit\n```"
