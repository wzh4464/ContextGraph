Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\n[BUG] `append_values` incorrectly extends `time_index` of `pd.RangeIndex`-typed `TimeSeries`\n**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen `append_values` is used to add new values to a `pd.RangeIndex`-typed `TimeSeries` , the `time_index` of the entire series is 'reset' so that each value is labeled with its index position. This is particularly unexpected if the `TimeSeries` in question does not have a frequency of `1` and/or does not start with a `time_index` of `0`.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nConsider the following example:\r\n```python\r\nfrom darts.utils.timeseries_generation import linear_timeseries\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nseries = linear_timeseries(start=1, length=5, freq=2)\r\nprint('Before `append_values`:')\r\nprint(list(series.time_index))\r\nnew_values = np.ones((1,))\r\nprint('After `append_values`:')\r\nprint(list(series.append_values(new_values).time_index))\r\n```\r\nThis yields:\r\n```\r\nBefore `append_values`:\r\n[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\r\nAfter `append_values`:\r\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\r\n```\r\nNotice how the `time_index` now starts at `0` instead of `1` **and** has a frequency of `1` instead of `2`.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nInstead of resetting the `time_index` of `pd.RangeIndex`-typed `TimeSeries`, `append_values` should 'extend' the `time_index`. More explicitly, for the previous example, one should expect the output:\r\n```\r\nBefore `append_values`:\r\n[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\r\nAfter `append_values`:\r\n[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]\r\n```\r\nIndeed, this is the [behaviour that's advertised by `append_values`' docstring](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.timeseries.html#darts.timeseries.TimeSeries.append_values) and, additionally, is how it behaves when dealing with `pd.DatetimeIndex`-typed `TimeSeries`. To see this, consider the following example:\r\n```python\r\nfrom darts.utils.timeseries_generation import linear_timeseries\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nseries = linear_timeseries(start=pd.Timestamp('1/1/2000'), length=2, freq='2d')\r\nprint('Before `append_values`:')\r\nprint(list(series.time_index))\r\nnew_values = np.ones((1,))\r\nprint('After `append_values`:')\r\nprint(list(series.append_values(new_values).time_index))\r\n```\r\nThis prints:\r\n```\r\nBefore `append_values`:\r\n[Timestamp('2000-01-01 00:00:00', freq='2D'), Timestamp('2000-01-03 00:00:00', freq='2D')]\r\nAfter `append_values`:\r\n[Timestamp('2000-01-01 00:00:00', freq='2D'), Timestamp('2000-01-03 00:00:00', freq='2D'), Timestamp('2000-01-05 00:00:00', freq='2D')]\r\n```\r\nNotice how the `append_values` has simply added the date `2000-01-05` to the `time_index` of `series`.\r\n\r\nIn cases where the user really wants 'reset' the `time_index` of a `TimeSeries` after appending values, this should probably be achieved by implementing a separate `TimeSeries.reset_index()` method.\r\n\r\n**System (please complete the following information):**\r\n - Python version: 3.10.6\r\n - darts version: 0.22.0\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nN/A\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /darts)\nbash-$"

The `RangeIndex` case is the one we're interested in since it's where the issue occurs. \n\nThe current implementation for `RangeIndex` creates a new index starting from the current length of the series and increments it by the frequency for each new value. This is likely where the issue is, since it does not take into account the existing range of the index, and simply starts from 0.\n\nWe need to modify the `RangeIndex` case to extend the existing index by adding the new values to the end of the range.
