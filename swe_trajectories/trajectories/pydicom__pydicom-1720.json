Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nStrict adherence to VR during parsing is detrimental due to commonplace vendor interpretations\n**Describe the bug**\r\nDICOM Files from GE modalities, which when parsed, raise a TypeError caused by \"violating\" the VR imposed by the DICOM standard; however, real world modalities have and continue to generate such files for good cause.\r\n\r\nFor example the following is raised\r\n\r\n`TypeError('Could not convert value to integer without loss')`\r\n\r\nby a real world DICOM file which has a value\r\n\r\n`(0018,1152) IS [14.5]                                   #   4, 1 Exposure`\r\n\r\nwhere IS is a Value Representation defined as\r\n\r\n> IS - Integer String\r\n\r\n> A string of characters representing an Integer in base-10 (decimal), shall contain only the characters 0 - 9, with an optional leading \"+\" or \"-\". It may be padded with leading and/or trailing spaces. Embedded spaces are not allowed.\r\n\r\n> The integer, n, represented shall be in the range: -231<= n <= (231-1).\r\n\r\n[See DICOM Part 5 Section 6.2](https://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part05/sect_6.2.html)\r\n\r\nwhich means `14.5` is an invalid value due to the fractional portion .5 which definitely would lead to a loss in precision if converted to a pure integer value (of 14). \r\n\r\nAfter discussion with a senior engineer for the vendor, the following dialogue was obtained which quotes an article by David Clune, a well-respected, long-time member of the DICOM committee and community:\r\n\r\n> The tag pair in question is meant to contain the mAs value used for the exposure, which is not constrained to integer values, but for some reason the DICOM standard defines it as such.\r\n\r\n> An interesting article from someone responsible for maintaining the DICOM documentation explains the conundrum quite well:  \r\n\r\nhttp://dclunie.blogspot.com/2008/11/dicom-exposure-attribute-fiasco.html\r\n\r\n> Of note are two excerpts from that article:\r\n\r\n> \"The original ACR-NEMA standard specified ASCII numeric data elements for Exposure, Exposure Time and X-Ray Tube Current that could be decimal values; for no apparent reason DICOM 3.0 in 1993 constrained these to be integers, which for some modalities and subjects are too small to be sufficiently precise\"\r\n\r\n> and\r\n\r\n> \"The authors of DICOM, in attempting to maintain some semblance of backward compatibility with ACR-NEMA and at the same time apply more precise constraints, re-defined all ACR-NEMA data elements of VR AN as either IS or DS, the former being the AN integer numbers (with new size constraints), and the latter being the AN fixed point and floating point numbers. In the process of categorizing the old data elements into either IS or DS, not only were the obvious integers (like counts of images and other things) made into integers, but it appears that also any \"real world\" attribute that in somebody's expert opinion did not need greater precision than a whole integer, was so constrained as well.\"\r\n\r\n> I have inspected a few random DICOM files generated by various modalities and the value is stored accurately, even though it is a violation of the explicit value representation. Additionally, I have worked with (and support) various PACS platforms, and this is the first time this has been raised as an issue. So technically, you are correct that encoding that value as decimal violates the explicit VR, but it appears to be common practice to do so. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nTo deal with the reality of history with respect to the current standard, my opinion, as a long-standing DICOM PACS implementer at Medstrat, is that there is nothing to gain and everything to lose by raising a `TypeError` here. For cases where an integer VR, such as `IS`, could be read as a floating point number instead, then it should be allowed to be so, for at least a limited whitelist of tags.\r\n\r\nArguments against which come to mind are of the ilk that do not heed \"Although practicality beats purity\" as can be read if you \r\n\r\n[`>>> import this`](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/)\r\n\r\n> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\r\n> Although practicality beats purity.\r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n`(0018,1152) IS [14.5]                                   #   4, 1 Exposure`\r\n\r\nSet any DICOM file to have the above for `Exposure` and then do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> from pydicom import config\r\n>>> pydicom.__version__\r\n'2.3.0'\r\n>>> config.settings.reading_validation_mode = config.IGNORE\r\n>>> ds = pydicom.dcmread('1.2.840.113619.2.107.20220429121335.1.1.dcm')\r\n>>> ds\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pydicom/dataset.py\", line 2306, in __str__\r\n    return self._pretty_str()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pydicom/dataset.py\", line 2020, in _pretty_str\r\n    for elem in self:\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pydicom/dataset.py\", line 1240, in __iter__\r\n    yield self[tag]\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pydicom/dataset.py\", line 939, in __getitem__\r\n    self[tag] = DataElement_from_raw(elem, character_set, self)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pydicom/dataelem.py\", line 859, in DataElement_from_raw\r\n    value = convert_value(vr, raw, encoding)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pydicom/values.py\", line 771, in convert_value\r\n    return converter(byte_string, is_little_endian, num_format)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pydicom/values.py\", line 348, in convert_IS_string\r\n    return MultiString(num_string, valtype=pydicom.valuerep.IS)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pydicom/valuerep.py\", line 1213, in MultiString\r\n    return valtype(splitup[0])\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pydicom/valuerep.py\", line 1131, in __new__\r\n    raise TypeError(\"Could not convert value to integer without loss\")\r\nTypeError: Could not convert value to integer without loss\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your environment**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmodule       | version\r\n------       | -------\r\nplatform     | Darwin-21.5.0-x86_64-i386-64bit\r\nPython       | 3.7.5 (v3.7.5:5c02a39a0b, Oct 14 2019, 18:49:57)  [Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)]\r\npydicom      | 2.2.2\r\ngdcm         | _module not found_\r\njpeg_ls      | _module not found_\r\nnumpy        | _module not found_\r\nPIL          | _module not found_\r\npylibjpeg    | _module not found_\r\nopenjpeg     | _module not found_\r\nlibjpeg      | _module not found_\r\n```\r\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /pydicom)\nbash-$"
