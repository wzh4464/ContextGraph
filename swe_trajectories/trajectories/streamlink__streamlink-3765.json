Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\n--http[s]-proxy does not properly handle schemeless inputs with port due to urllib behavior change in python 3.9\n## Bug Report\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace the space character between the square brackets with an x in order to check the boxes -->\r\n- [X] This is a bug report and I have read the contribution guidelines.\r\n- [X] I am using the latest development version from the master branch.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain the bug as thoroughly as you can. Don't leave out information which is necessary for us to reproduce and debug this issue. -->\r\n\r\nWhile troubleshooting an issue with a project that consumes Streamlink by way of its CLI, I discovered an apparent bug in the interaction between Streamlink and urllib w/r/t how proxy URL inputs are handled - stemming from a behavior change in urllib in Python 3.9.\r\n\r\nIf the input for `--http[s]-proxy` is provided in host:port or IP:port notation WITHOUT a scheme (e.g. `--http-proxy 127.0.0.1:8050`), the `update_scheme()` function does not actually add a scheme to it under Python 3.9. When the still-schemeless url is then fed to urllib3 for connection setup, it fails with a `ProxySchemeUnknown` exception.\r\n\r\nThe behavior here appears to be caused by urllib's `urlparse()` function, rather than Streamlink itself, but the intent of the Python developers seems to be that the behavior change is handled by client applications.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n[44007: urlparse(\"host:123\", \"http\") inconsistent between 3.8 and 3.9](https://bugs.python.org/issue44007)\r\nwhich leads to:\r\n[27657: urlparse fails if the path is numeric](https://bugs.python.org/issue27657) as the source of the behavior change\r\n\r\nIn the latter bug (specifically here: https://bugs.python.org/issue27657#msg371024) it's noted that the behavior change was apparently intentional and consumers of urllib are expected to handle it.\r\n\r\n### Expected / Actual behavior\r\n\r\n<!-- What do you expect to happen, and what is actually happening? -->\r\n\r\nExpected: A scheme-less host:port or ip:port input to a proxy option (e.g. `--http-proxy 127.0.0.1:8050`) should be reformatted by `update_scheme()` to the appropriate format (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8050`) before being used as input to urllib3.\r\n\r\nActual: *In Python 3.9* the value is used as-is, and because there is no http/https scheme on the URL, urllib3 throws a `ProxySchemeUnknown` exception. (`Proxy URL had no scheme, should start with http:// or https://`).\r\n\r\n### Reproduction steps / Explicit stream URLs to test\r\n\r\n<!-- How can we reproduce this? Please note the exact steps below using the list format supplied. If you need more steps please add them. -->\r\n\r\nThe observed behavior can be abstracted entirely away from the Streamlink CLI.\r\n\r\nIn session.py, we have the following (https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink/blob/master/src/streamlink/session.py#L279-L285):\r\n\r\n```\r\n        elif key == \"http-proxy\":\r\n            self.http.proxies[\"http\"] = update_scheme(\"http://\", value)\r\n            if \"https\" not in self.http.proxies:\r\n                self.http.proxies[\"https\"] = update_scheme(\"http://\", value)\r\n\r\n        elif key == \"https-proxy\":\r\n            self.http.proxies[\"https\"] = update_scheme(\"https://\", value)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `update_scheme()` function should apply the appropriate scheme to the URL, but on *Python 3.9* it does not in the case of a schemeless input with port:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPython 3.9.5 (default, May 24 2021, 12:50:35) \r\n[GCC 11.1.0] on linux\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> from streamlink import utils\r\n>>> utils.update_scheme(\"http://\", \"127.0.0.1:8050\")\r\n'127.0.0.1:8050'\r\n>>> utils.update_scheme(\"https://\", \"127.0.0.1:8050\")\r\n'127.0.0.1:8050'\r\n>>> utils.update_scheme(\"https://\", \"localhost:8050\")\r\n'localhost:8050'\r\n>>> utils.update_scheme(\"https://\", \"localhost\")\r\n'https://localhost'\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the only properly-handled input above was the \"schemeless hostname without port\" case - any schemeless input _with_ port does not get the expected scheme added.\r\n\r\nThe root of this issue is actually in urllib, as `update_scheme()` calls `urlparse()` from urllib. In Python 3.8, the `urlparse` call results in the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPython 3.8.10 (default, May 12 2021, 15:46:43) \r\n[GCC 8.3.0] on linux\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> from urllib import parse\r\n>>> parse.urlparse('127.0.0.1:8080')\r\nParseResult(scheme='', netloc='', path='127.0.0.1:8080', params='', query='', fragment='')\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereas in Python 3.9, the folloiwng occurs:\r\n```\r\nPython 3.9.5 (default, May 12 2021, 15:26:36) \r\n[GCC 8.3.0] on linux\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> from urllib import parse\r\n>>> parse.urlparse('127.0.0.1:8080')\r\nParseResult(scheme='127.0.0.1', netloc='', path='8080', params='', query='', fragment='')\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote in the latter case, urllib returns the IP address in the `scheme` portion of the tuple instead of ... anywhere else (I'm honestly not sure if it should end up in `netloc` or `path`).\r\n\r\n### Log output\r\n\r\nThe consumer of Streamlink which I was troubleshooting (LazyMan) shells out to Streamlink with `--https-proxy 127.0.0.1:<port>` - a schemeless url with port - as seen here: https://github.com/StevensNJD4/LazyMan/blob/master/src/Objects/Streamlink.java#L45\r\n\r\nThis results in the following output from LM when run on a system with Python 3.9:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-----\r\n\r\n-----\r\nStreamlink starting...\r\nurlparse was ParseResult(scheme='hlsvariant', netloc='<censored> name_key=bitrate verify=False', params='', query='', fragment='')\r\ngot https-proxy 127.0.0.1:8050\r\nurlparse was ParseResult(scheme='127.0.0.1', netloc='', path='8050', params='', query='', fragment='')\r\noutput of update_scheme is 127.0.0.1:8050\r\nurlparse was ParseResult(scheme='127.0.0.1', netloc='', path='8050', params='', query='', fragment='')\r\nself.http.proxies['https'] is 127.0.0.1:8050\r\n[cli][debug] OS:         Linux-5.12.7-arch1-1-x86_64-with-glibc2.33\r\n[cli][debug] Python:     3.9.5\r\n[cli][debug] Streamlink: 2.1.1\r\n[cli][debug] Requests(2.25.1), Socks(1.7.1), Websocket(0.59.0)\r\n[cli][debug] Arguments:\r\n[cli][debug]  url=hlsvariant://<censored> name_key=bitrate verify=False\r\n[cli][debug]  stream=['best']\r\n[cli][debug]  --loglevel=debug\r\n[cli][debug]  --hls-segment-threads=4\r\n[cli][debug]  --https-proxy=127.0.0.1:8050\r\n[cli][debug]  --http-header=[('User-Agent', 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0;

Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /streamlink)\nbash-$"
