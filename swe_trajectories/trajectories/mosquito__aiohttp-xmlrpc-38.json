Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nkwargs parsing seems incorrect\nHi,\r\n\r\nThis is a great project and exactly what I am looking for. However when I did some test on server code, it responds inconsistently with python native xmlrpc library. Here is my parameter:\r\n```\r\n<param>\r\n    <value>\r\n        <i4>100</i4>\r\n    </value>\r\n</param>\r\n<param>\r\n    <value>\r\n        <i4>200</i4>\r\n    </value>\r\n</param>\r\n<param>\r\n    <value>\r\n        <struct>\r\n            <member>\r\n                <name>key1</name>\r\n                <value>\r\n                    <i4>1</i4>\r\n                </value>\r\n            </member>\r\n            <member>\r\n                <name>key2</name>\r\n                <value>\r\n                    <i4>2</i4>\r\n                </value>\r\n            </member>\r\n        </struct>\r\n    </value>\r\n</param>\r\n```\r\naiohttp-xmlrpc will parse it as one argument list with 2 elements(100 and 200) and one named argument with 2 keys(`key1` and `key2`), while python3's native xmlrpc will parse it as one argument list with 3 elements (`(100, 200, {'key1': 1, 'key2': 2})`)\r\nHere is the code I use for native xmlrpc:\r\n```\r\nfrom xmlrpc.server import SimpleXMLRPCServer\r\n\r\ndef ping():\r\n    return 'Pong'\r\n\r\ndef echo( *args, **kwargs):\r\n    return (args, kwargs)\r\n\r\ndef test():\r\n    return None\r\n\r\ndef args(*args):\r\n    return len(args)\r\n\r\ndef kwargs(**kwargs):\r\n    return len(kwargs)\r\n\r\ndef args_kwargs(*args, **kwargs):\r\n    print(args)\r\n    print(kwargs)\r\n    return len(args) + len(kwargs)\r\n\r\ndef exception():\r\n    raise Exception(\"YEEEEEE!!!\")\r\n\r\nserver = SimpleXMLRPCServer((\"localhost\", 8080),allow_none=True)\r\nprint(\"Listening on port 8080...\")\r\nserver.register_function(ping, \"ping\")\r\nserver.register_function(echo, \"echo\")\r\nserver.register_function(test, \"test\")\r\nserver.register_function(args, \"args\")\r\nserver.register_function(kwargs, \"kwargs\")\r\nserver.register_function(args_kwargs, \"args_kwargs\")\r\n\r\nserver.serve_forever()\r\n```\r\n\r\nserver on aiohttp-xmlrpc one:\r\n```\r\nfrom aiohttp import web\r\nfrom aiohttp_xmlrpc import handler\r\n\r\nclass XMLRPCExample(handler.XMLRPCView):\r\n    def rpc_ping(self):\r\n        return 'Pong'\r\n\r\n    def rpc_echo(self, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        return (args, kwargs)\r\n\r\n    def rpc_test(self):\r\n        return None\r\n\r\n    def rpc_args(self, *args):\r\n        return len(args)\r\n\r\n    def rpc_kwargs(self, **kwargs):\r\n        return len(kwargs)\r\n\r\n    def rpc_args_kwargs(self, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        print(args)\r\n        print(kwargs)\r\n        return len(args) + len(kwargs)\r\n\r\n    def rpc_exception(self):\r\n        raise Exception(\"YEEEEEE!!!\")\r\n\r\ndef start_server():\r\n    app = web.Application()\r\n    app.router.add_route('*', '/', XMLRPCExample)\r\n    web.run_app(app)\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    start_server()\r\n```\r\nI called the same method of `args_kwargs` on client side. But results are 4 for aiohttp-xmlrpc and 3 for xmlrpc.\r\n(BTW, I use https://xmlrpc.devzing.com/ tool to call rpc service which is running locally and tunnelled by ngork). \r\n\r\nI think `xmlrpc` is doing the right way. Maybe there are some configurations I missed or some tests I did incorrectly? \n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /aiohttp-xmlrpc)\nbash-$"

      "text": "The `handler.py` file contains the `XMLRPCView` class, which is responsible for handling XML-RPC requests. The `_handle` method seems to be the entry point for handling requests, and it calls other methods like `_parse_body`, `_lookup_method`, and `_check_request` to process the request.\n\nThe `_parse_body` method uses `etree` to parse the XML request body, and the `_lookup_method` method finds the appropriate method to call based on the request. The `_check_request` method ensures that the request has an XML content type.\n\nThe part of the code that might be relevant to the issue is where the arguments are parsed and passed to the registered functions. This seems to happen in the `_handle` method, specifically around the lines where `args` and `kwargs` are defined.\n\nTo address the issue, we might need to modify the code to ensure that the arguments are parsed correctly and passed to the functions in a way that is consistent with the native XML-RPC library.\n\nBefore we make any changes, let's consider the issue described. The problem seems to be that `aiohttp-xmlrpc` parses the request into two arguments (100 and 200) and one named argument (`{'key1': 1, 'key2': 2}`), while the native XML-RPC library parses it as one argument list with three elements (`(100, 200, {'key1': 1, 'key2': 2})`).\n\nThis suggests that we need to modify the code to combine the arguments into a single list if there are no named arguments. Let's edit the `_handle` method to address this issue.\n```\nedit 90:93\n        if args and isinstance(args[-1], dict):\n            kwargs = args.pop(-1)\n        else:\n            kwargs = {}\n            if not kwargs:\n                args = [args]\nend_of_edit\n```"

      "text": "The `handler.py` file contains the `XMLRPCView` class, which is responsible for handling XML-RPC requests. The `_handle` method seems to be the entry point for handling requests, and it calls other methods like `_parse_body`, `_lookup_method`, and `_check_request` to process the request.\n\nThe `_parse_body` method uses `etree` to parse the XML request body, and the `_lookup_method` method finds the appropriate method to call based on the request. The `_check_request` method ensures that the request has an XML content type.\n\nThe part of the code that might be relevant to the issue is where the arguments are parsed and passed to the registered functions. This seems to happen in the `_handle` method, specifically around the lines where `args` and `kwargs` are defined.\n\nTo address the issue, we might need to modify the code to ensure that the arguments are parsed correctly and passed to the functions in a way that is consistent with the native XML-RPC library.\n\nBefore we make any changes, let's consider the issue described. The problem seems to be that `aiohttp-xmlrpc` parses the request into two arguments (100 and 200) and one named argument (`{'key1': 1, 'key2': 2}`), while the native XML-RPC library parses it as one argument list with three elements (`(100, 200, {'key1': 1, 'key2': 2})`).\n\nThis suggests that we need to modify the code to combine the arguments into a single list if there are no named arguments. Let's edit the `_handle` method to address this issue.\n```\nedit 90:93\n        if args and isinstance(args[-1], dict):\n            kwargs = args.pop(-1)\n        else:\n            kwargs = {}\n            if not kwargs:\n                args = [args]\nend_of_edit\n```"

      "text": "The `handler.py` file contains the `XMLRPCView` class, which is responsible for handling XML-RPC requests. The `_handle` method seems to be the entry point for handling requests, and it calls other methods like `_parse_body`, `_lookup_method`, and `_check_request` to process the request.\n\nThe `_parse_body` method uses `etree` to parse the XML request body, and the `_lookup_method` method finds the appropriate method to call based on the request. The `_check_request` method ensures that the request has an XML content type.\n\nThe part of the code that might be relevant to the issue is where the arguments are parsed and passed to the registered functions. This seems to happen in the `_handle` method, specifically around the lines where `args` and `kwargs` are defined.\n\nTo address the issue, we might need to modify the code to ensure that the arguments are parsed correctly and passed to the functions in a way that is consistent with the native XML-RPC library.\n\nBefore we make any changes, let's consider the issue described. The problem seems to be that `aiohttp-xmlrpc` parses the request into two arguments (100 and 200) and one named argument (`{'key1': 1, 'key2': 2}`), while the native XML-RPC library parses it as one argument list with three elements (`(100, 200, {'key1': 1, 'key2': 2})`).\n\nThis suggests that we need to modify the code to combine the arguments into a single list if there are no named arguments. Let's edit the `_handle` method to address this issue.\n```\nedit 90:97\n        if args and isinstance(args[-1], dict):\n            kwargs = args.pop(-1)\n        else:\n            kwargs = {}\n            if not kwargs:\n                args = [args]\nend_of_edit\n```"

      "text": "The `handler.py` file contains the `XMLRPCView` class, which is responsible for handling XML-RPC requests. The `_handle` method seems to be the entry point for handling requests, and it calls other methods like `_parse_body`, `_lookup_method`, and `_check_request` to process the request.\n\nThe `_parse_body` method uses `etree` to parse the XML request body, and the `_lookup_method` method finds the appropriate method to call based on the request. The `_check_request` method ensures that the request has an XML content type.\n\nThe part of the code that might be relevant to the issue is where the arguments are parsed and passed to the registered functions. This seems to happen in the `_handle` method, specifically around the lines where `args` and `kwargs` are defined.\n\nTo address the issue, we might need to modify the code to ensure that the arguments are parsed correctly and passed to the functions in a way that is consistent with the native XML-RPC library.\n\nBefore we make any changes, let's consider the issue described. The problem seems to be that `aiohttp-xmlrpc` parses the request into two arguments (100 and 200) and one named argument (`{'key1': 1, 'key2': 2}`), while the native XML-RPC library parses it as one argument list with three elements (`(100, 200, {'key1': 1, 'key2': 2})`).\n\nThis suggests that we need to modify the code to combine the arguments into a single list if there are no named arguments.

      "text": "The `handler.py` file contains the `XMLRPCView` class, which is responsible for handling XML-RPC requests. The `_handle` method seems to be the entry point for handling requests, and it calls other methods like `_parse_body`, `_lookup_method`, and `_check_request` to process the request.\n\nThe `_parse_body` method uses `etree` to parse the XML request body, and the `_lookup_method` method finds the appropriate method to call based on the request. The `_check_request` method ensures that the request has an XML content type.\n\nThe part of the code that might be relevant to the issue is where the arguments are parsed and passed to the registered functions. This seems to happen in the `_handle` method, specifically around the lines where `args` and `kwargs` are defined.\n\nTo address the issue, we might need to modify the code to ensure that the arguments are parsed correctly and passed to the functions in a way that is consistent with the native XML-RPC library.\n\nBefore we make any changes, let's consider the issue described. The problem seems to be that `aiohttp-xmlrpc` parses the request into two arguments (100 and 200) and one named argument (`{'key1': 1, 'key2': 2}`), while the native XML-RPC library parses it as one argument list with three elements (`(100, 200, {'key1': 1, 'key2': 2})`).\n\nThis suggests that we need to modify the code to combine the arguments into a single list if there are no named arguments. Let's edit the `_handle` method to address this issue.\n```\nedit 90:97\n        if args and isinstance(args[-1], dict):\n            kwargs = args.pop(-1)\n        else:\n            kwargs = {}\n            if not kwargs:\n                args = [args]\nend_of_edit\n```"
